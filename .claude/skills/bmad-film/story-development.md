# Story Development - Ghosh-Raghavan Method

Welcome to deep story development inspired by the narrative mastery of
**Sujoy Ghosh** (Kahaani, Badla) and **Sriram Raghavan** (Andhadhun, Badlapur).

This is not a quick outline. This is comprehensive story architecture where we:
- **Excavate** what your story is REALLY about (theme beneath plot)
- **Build worlds** so real that impossible things feel inevitable
- **Design characters** as complex humans, not heroes or villains
- **Structure narratives** with layers that reward attentive viewing
- **Craft dialogue** where what's NOT said matters most

**Estimated Time**: 4-8 hours (we can break into sessions if needed)

**Best For**: Thrillers, suspense, neo-noir, psychological dramas, character-driven stories

**Philosophy**:
> "It's never about the climax, but the journey leading to it." - Sujoy Ghosh

> "Every character is well etched out... because they all are human beings
> and stories are on the situation and the human mind." - Sriram Raghavan

Ready to begin? Let's excavate your story.

```

## Phase 1: The Excavation (Story Architect Leads)

```markdown
## Phase 1: The Excavation - Discovering Story Core

**Agent**: Story Architect
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes

I'll ask you a series of questions to excavate what your story is REALLY about.
Don't worry if you don't have all the answers yet—that's what this process reveals.

### Initial Story Concept

First, tell me what you have so far:

1. **The Idea**: What's your story concept or "what if?" premise?
   [User provides initial idea]

2. **Target Format**: What are you making?
   - [ ] 15-minute short film
   - [ ] 30-45 minute short film
   - [ ] 60-90 minute feature film
   - [ ] Web series episode
   - [ ] Other: _______

3. **Genre/Tone**: How would you describe the feel?
   - [ ] Thriller/Suspense (Kahaani-style atmospheric)
   - [ ] Neo-noir crime (Badlapur-style dark)
   - [ ] Psychological drama
   - [ ] Mystery
   - [ ] Other: _______

### The Ghosh Questions (Journey & World)

Now, let's dig deeper using Sujoy Ghosh's approach:

**Q1: What is this story REALLY about?**
(Not plot—theme. What human question does it explore?)

Examples:
- Kahaani is really about maternal strength and revenge disguised as search
- Your story is really about... ?

[User responds]

**Q2: Whose story is this?**
(Who is the protagonist whose journey we follow?)

[User responds]

**Q3: What world does this story live in?**
(Geographic, cultural, social setting—be specific)

Like Kolkata in Kahaani isn't backdrop—it's active character.
Where/when does your story take place? What makes this setting essential?

[User responds]

**Q4: What's the journey?**
(Not just "what happens"—what does protagonist experience/discover?)

Remember: "It's never about the climax, but the journey leading to it."

[User responds]

**Q5: Where's the mystery?**
(What keeps audience invested? What are they trying to figure out?)

[User responds]

### The Raghavan Questions (Moral Ambiguity & Puzzle)

Now, let's add Sriram Raghavan's complexity:

**Q6: What's the moral ambiguity?**
(Where are the grey areas? What makes protagonist's choices difficult?)

Raghavan's characters aren't heroes/villains—they're humans in impossible situations.
What moral crossroads will your protagonist face?

[User responds]

**Q7: What ordinary person faces what extraordinary situation?**
(Raghavan's protagonists are middle-class, relatable, then tested)

Who is your protagonist BEFORE the story disrupts their life?
What's their ordinary normalcy?

[User responds]

**Q8: What does the audience think they know?**
(How will you subvert expectations? What puzzle are they solving?)

[User responds]

**Q9: What's the karmic architecture?**
(How do early choices plant seeds for later consequences?)

[User responds]

**Q10: What's compelling about this premise that ONLY cinema can capture?**
(Why film, not novel or stage play?)

[User responds]

## Phase 2: World-Building (Story Architect)

```markdown
## Phase 2: World Before Character

**Principle**: "Your characters won't be real if your world isn't real." - Ghosh

**Duration**: 30-45 minutes

Before we design characters, let's fully establish the world they inhabit.

### Geographic & Cultural Setting

**Location**: [Specific city/region, not just "India" or "Mumbai"]
- What neighborhood/area specifically?
- What's the socioeconomic reality?
- What cultural/regional identity?

**Time Period**: [When does this take place?]
- Contemporary? Specific year?
- How does timing affect story?

### The World as Character

Following Ghosh's approach (Kolkata in Kahaani), how does your setting:

1. **Create obstacles**? [How does world make protagonist's goal harder?]
2. **Create opportunities**? [How does world enable story to happen?]
3. **Reflect character state**? [How does setting mirror/contrast protagonist?]
4. **Have its own atmosphere**? [What's the mood, texture, sensory quality?]

### Cultural Authenticity

**Language & Dialect**:
- What languages are spoken?
- Any Hindi-English code-switching?
- Regional accent/dialect specifics?
- Class markers in speech?

**Cultural Elements**:
- Festivals, customs, social norms?
- Power structures, hierarchies?
- What's considered normal vs. transgressive?

### Rules of This World

What's possible and impossible in this world?
- Realistic/naturalistic? Or heightened reality?
- Any genre-specific rules (thriller conventions, noir tropes)?
- What can characters do? What are limits?

## Phase 3: Character Design (Character Designer Leads)

```markdown
## Phase 3: Designing Humans, Not Heroes

**Agent**: Character Designer
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes

Now that world is established, let's populate it with complex, morally ambiguous humans.

### Protagonist Design

#### Part A: Ordinary Normalcy (Raghavan Approach)

Before tragedy/disruption, who is your protagonist in their everyday life?

**Occupation**: [Be specific—not "businessman" but "mid-level accounts manager at pharmaceutical company"]

**Daily Routine**: [What does a typical day look like?]

**Social Circle**: [Who are their people? Family? Friends?]

**Moral Baseline**: [What rules do they live by BEFORE story tests them?]

**Ordinary Details**: [What makes them recognizable, relatable, real?]

#### Part B: Psychological Core

**Want (External Goal)**: [What do they consciously pursue in the story?]

**Need (Internal Growth)**: [What do they actually require for fulfillment?]
(Often different from or opposite to Want)

**Core Fear**: [What terrifies them? Helplessness? Exposure? Loss?]

**Core Desire**: [What do they crave? Justice? Safety? Love? Recognition?]

#### Part C: Moral Architecture (Raghavan's Domain)

**Starting Point on Moral Spectrum**:
```
LIGHT ←―――→ GREY ←―――→ DARK

[Mark where they start]
```

**The Moral Crossroads**:
What choice will have NO clear right answer?
What situation will force them to compromise their values?

**The Slide Trajectory**:
If they descend into darkness (like Badlapur's Raghu), what's the path?
- First compromise: [Small rule-breaking]
- Escalation: [Bigger transgression]
- Point of No Return: [The choice that changes everything]

**Capacity for Darkness**:
How far CAN they go? What's their breaking point?

**Capacity for Light**:
Even in darkness, what humanity remains?

#### Part D: Character Arc

**Starting State**: [Who are they at story beginning?]

**Transformation Type**:
- [ ] Change Arc (flawed → transformed)
- [ ] Growth Arc (incomplete → complete)
- [ ] Fall Arc (innocent → corrupted)
- [ ] Flat Arc (unchanging, world changes around them)

**Key Choice Points**: [What decisions drive their transformation?]
- Choice 1 (Act 1): [Decision + consequence]
- Choice 2 (Midpoint): [Decision + consequence]
- Choice 3 (Act 3): [Decision + consequence]

**Ending State**: [Who have they become? What has changed?]

#### Part E: Strength & Vulnerability

**Mental Strength** (Ghosh's "Strong in the Head"):
- Intelligence: [How smart? In what way?]
- Resilience: [How do they cope with adversity?]
- Adaptability: [How quickly do they adjust to new situations?]

**Vulnerability** (What makes them human):
- Weakness: [What can break them?]
- Blind spot: [What don't they see?]
- Contradiction: [What do they believe that's wrong?]

---

### Supporting Characters & Antagonist(s)

[Character Designer works through each major supporting character]

**For Each Supporting Character**:
- Who are they in relation to protagonist?
- What do THEY want?
- How do they challenge/support protagonist?
- What's THEIR moral complexity?

**For Antagonist** (if applicable):
Remember: No villains, only humans with motivations

- What do they believe they're fighting FOR (not just against)?
- How are they similar to protagonist? (Mirror characters)
- What's sympathetic about them?
- What's terrifying about them?

## Phase 4: Narrative Structure (Story Architect Returns)

```markdown
## Phase 4: Layered Narrative Architecture

**Agent**: Story Architect (with Character Designer input)
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes

Now we structure the story incorporating the characters we've designed.

### Structural Approach Selection

Based on your story, I recommend:

**Option A: Ghosh Method** (Atmospheric Journey)
- Setup → Journey begins → Atmospheric discoveries →
  Layered reveals → Ambiguous ending
- Best for: Mystery, discovery-driven, immersive atmospherics

**Option B: Raghavan Method** (Neo-Noir Descent)
- Setup → Inciting violence → Moral slide →
  Complications from unpredictability → Karmic consequences
- Best for: Revenge, crime, moral complexity, character transformation

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- [Custom combination based on your story needs]

Which resonates with your story? [User selects]

### Three-Act Structure with Layers

**ACT 1: Setup & Disruption** (~25% of runtime)

**Scene 1-X: Ordinary World**
- Establish protagonist in normalcy
- Show what they have to lose
- Introduce world and tone

**Inciting Incident**: [What disrupts their life?]
- Scene #: _______
- What happens:

**Act 1 Climax**: [Protagonist commits to journey]
- Scene #: _______
- What they decide:
- Point of no return:

**ACT 2: Complications & Descent** (~50% of runtime)

**Rising Action**: [Obstacles escalate, moral choices accumulate]

Key Sequences:
1. [Sequence name]: Scenes ___-___ - [What happens]
2. [Sequence name]: Scenes ___-___ - [What happens]
3. [Sequence name]: Scenes ___-___ - [What happens]

**Midpoint Shift**: [Major revelation or turning point]
- Scene #: _______
- What we thought was happening:
- What's actually happening:
- How this changes protagonist's strategy:

**Darkest Moment**: [All seems lost, lowest point]
- Scene #: _______

- Character at breaking point:

**ACT 3: Climax & Resolution** (~25% of runtime)

**Climax**: [Confrontation/revelation/culmination]
- Scene #: _______
- What happens:
- Character's final choice defines who they've become:

**Resolution**:
- Scene #: _______
- How it ends:
- Ambiguous or clear:
- What lingers:

### Layered Plotting

**Surface Plot** (What appears to be happening):
[Plot as audience first understands it]

**Hidden Plot** (What's actually happening):
[The truth beneath surface appearances]

**Thematic Plot** (What it means):
[The deeper human question being explored]

### Information Architecture

Timeline of what audience learns when:

| Scene | Audience Sees | Audience Suspects | Audience Discovers |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1-5   | [Info visible] | [Doubts planted] | [Nothing yet] |
| 6-10  | [Info visible] | [Growing doubts] | [First small reveal] |
| 11-15 | [Info visible] | [Confusion/questions] | [Major reveal] |
| 16+   | [Full picture] | [Final mysteries] | [Complete truth] |

### Complete Narrative Circle

**Opening Image/Moment**: [How story begins]

**Closing Image/Moment**: [How story ends]

**Connection**: [How closing mirrors/inverts/transforms opening]
(The "doorbell to doorbell" structural satisfaction)

## Phase 7: Dialogue Craft

```markdown
## Phase 7: Voice & Subtext

**Agent**: Dialogue Agent
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes

Now let's establish character voices and craft dialogue for key scenes.

### Character Voice Profiles

For EACH major character, I'll establish:

**[Character Name]**:
- **Education**: [Level affects vocabulary/structure]
- **Region**: [Accent, dialect, language mixing]
- **Baseline Emotion**: [How stress affects their speech]
- **Speech Patterns**: [Unique rhythms, habits, tics]
- **Code-Switching**: [When/how they shift between languages or registers]
- **What They'd NEVER Say**: [Character boundaries]

[Repeat for each character]

### Key Scene Dialogue

I won't write ALL dialogue—just key scenes to establish voice and demonstrate subtext.

#### Scene [X]: [Scene Name] - Character Introduction

**Context**: [What's happening in scene]

**Subtext Goal**: [What's really being communicated beneath surface]

```
INT. [LOCATION] - DAY

[CHARACTER A action line]

                CHARACTER A
          [Dialogue line]

[CHARACTER B reaction]

                CHARACTER B
          [Dialogue line]
                (beat)
          [Subtext-heavy line]
```

**Voice Notes**:
- Character A: [Why they speak this way]
- Character B: [Why they speak this way]

**Subtext Analysis**:

---

### Philosophical Reflection

You've built a story using principles from two masters:

**From Sujoy Ghosh**:
✓ Journey valued over climax
✓ World so real that extraordinary feels inevitable
✓ Atmospheric immersion and layered complexity
✓ Complete narrative circles for structural satisfaction

**From Sriram Raghavan**:
✓ Ordinary people revealing extraordinary depths
✓ Moral ambiguity more fascinating than clear morality
✓ Stories as puzzles for intelligent audiences
✓ Dark humor and karmic consequences

**Remember**: Cinema is about asking questions that linger long after
the lights come up. You've built a foundation for that kind of story.

Now go make it real. 🎬

**Files Created:**
- `project/development/story-architecture.md`
- `project/development/character-profiles/[character-name].md` (one per character)
- `project/development/screenplay-outline.md`
- `project/development/dialogue-samples/[scene-name].md` (key scenes)
- `project/film-project-context.md` (updated)

**Run `/project-status` to see updated project state**
```

---

## Error Handling

**If user's concept is too vague**:
- Story Architect conducts deeper excavation
- More probing questions to uncover core
- May need multiple rounds of questioning

**If characters feel like plot devices**:
- Character Designer digs deeper into psychology
- Focus on ordinary normalcy before disruption
- Establish want vs. need more clearly

**If screenplay scenes feel static**:
- Screenplay Developer applies "Are you sure?" more rigorously
- Check every scene for goal-obstacle-outcome-turn
- May need to cut or combine scenes

**If dialogue sounds unnatural**:
- Dialogue Agent focuses on character voice authenticity
- Read aloud test
- More attention to regional/cultural patterns

**If agents' outputs don't cohere**:
- Master Agent facilitates integration session
- Identifies conflicts and synthesizes solutions
- May need one agent to adjust based on another's work

---

## Success Criteria

Skill is successful when:
- ✓ Story has clear thematic core beneath plot
- ✓ World is established completely and believably
- ✓ Characters feel like real humans with moral ambiguity
- ✓ Narrative structure has integrity (complete circles)
- ✓ Layered plotting rewards attentive viewing
- ✓ Screenplay is scene-by-scene structured and shootable
- ✓ Dialogue has distinct voices and subtext
- ✓ Regional/cultural authenticity is genuine
- ✓ All elements (story, character, screenplay, dialogue) cohere into unified vision
- ✓ Filmmaker feels confident story is solid foundation for production

---

## Notes for Implementation

- This is an **iterative, conversational workflow**—not rigid checklist
- Agents should feel like collaborators, not interrogators
- Break into multiple sessions if needed (4-8 hours is substantial)
- User can pause and resume at any phase
- Agents adapt depth based on user's existing clarity
- Balance thoroughness with not overwhelming user
- Emphasize philosophy throughout—this isn't formulaic screenwriting
