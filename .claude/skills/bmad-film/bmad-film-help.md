## PIPELINE COMMANDS

### Step 1: Story Synopsis
```
/story-synopsis [project-name]
```
- Genre identification + specialist routing
- Interactive Q&A in Bollywood Hindi
- Multi-layered story with twists
- **Output**: `story-synopsis.md` + `genre-analysis.md`

### Step 2: Character Bible
```
/character-bible [project-name]
```
- Psychology-deep profiles (wound, want, need, fear)
- Voice patterns and dialect support
- Character arcs mapped

### Step 3: Beat Sheet
```
/beat-sheet [project-name]
```
- Story skeleton — every emotional/plot beat mapped
- Pacing and rhythm defined BEFORE writing dialogue
- Emotional arc visualization
- **Output**: `beat-sheet.md`

### Step 4: Screenplay
```
/screenplay [project-name]
/screenplay [project-name] in Haryanvi
/screenplay [project-name] in Punjabi

```
- TWO-AGENT Bollywood model:
  - Agent 1: Screenplay Structure Writer (scenes, action, blocking)
  - Agent 2: Dialogue Writer / Samvad Lekhak (impactful dialogue)
- Credits: "Screenplay by X | Dialogues by Y"
- **Output**: `screenplay-structure.md` + `screenplay.md` (final)

### Step 5: Shot Breakdown
```
/shot-breakdown [project-name]
```
- Shot-by-shot production plan
