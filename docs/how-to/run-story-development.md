# How to Run Story Development End-to-End

**Complete guide to using the `/story-development` command**

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Open Claude Code in Your Project Directory

```bash
cd /path/to/bmad-for-filmmaking
# Open in Claude Code
```

### Step 2: Run the Story Development Command

Simply type in Claude Code:

```
/story-development
```

### Step 3: Follow the Interactive Workflow

The system will guide you through 10 phases over 4-8 hours (can be broken into sessions).

---

## What You Need Before Starting

### Required Inputs

**Minimum to begin**:
1. **Story Concept** - Even a vague idea works (e.g., "A teacher seeking revenge")
2. **Target Format** - Short film (15-30 min) or feature film (60-120 min)
3. **Genre/Tone** - Thriller, neo-noir, suspense, psychological drama, etc.

**Optional but helpful**:
- Thematic interests (what questions intrigue you?)
- Character ideas you already have
- Setting preferences (Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, rural India, etc.)
- Reference films you love
- Narrative style preference (Ghosh atmospheric vs. Raghavan neo-noir)

### What NOT to Have

❌ **You DON'T need**:
- Complete script
- Fully developed characters
- Detailed outline
- All the answers

The workflow **discovers** these through collaborative interrogation.

## The 10-Phase Journey

### Phase 1: The Excavation (45-60 min)

**What Happens**:
- Story Architect asks probing questions about your concept
- Uses Ghosh-Raghavan philosophical framework
- Uncovers what story is REALLY about

**Your Role**:
- Answer questions honestly (even "I don't know" is valid)
- Think about theme, not just plot
- Be open to discovery

**Sample Questions You'll Get**:
```
Q: What is this story REALLY about? (Theme beneath plot)
Q: Whose story is this?
Q: What world does this story live in?
Q: What's the moral ambiguity?
Q: What ordinary person faces what extraordinary situation?
```

**Output**: Story excavation notes with core theme identified

---

### Phase 2: World Before Character (30-45 min)

**What Happens**:
- Story Architect establishes complete world foundation
- Setting becomes character, not backdrop
- Cultural authenticity embedded

**Your Role**:
- Describe setting specifically (not "Mumbai" but "Dharavi slums" or "Bandra high-rises")
- Think about how world affects character choices
- Consider cultural/regional elements

**Sample Questions You'll Get**:
```
Q: What specific location/neighborhood?
Q: What's the socioeconomic reality?
Q: How does this world create obstacles for protagonist?
Q: What cultural elements shape this world?
Q: What languages are spoken? Any code-switching?
```

**Output**: World-building bible document

---

### Phase 3: Character Design (60-90 min)

**What Happens**:
- Character Designer creates psychologically complex characters
- Ordinary normalcy → Want vs. Need → Moral spectrum → Arc
- Supporting characters and relationships

**Your Role**:
- Think about protagonist BEFORE story disrupts their life
- Consider their capacity for both light and darkness
- Define relationships and dynamics

**Sample Questions You'll Get**:
```
Q: What's protagonist's occupation? (Be specific)
Q: What's their daily routine before tragedy?
Q: What's their WANT (external goal) vs. NEED (internal growth)?
Q: What's their core fear and core desire?
Q: How far into darkness can they slide?
Q: What's their point of no return?
```

**Output**: Character bibles (one per major character)

---

### Phase 4: Narrative Architecture (45-60 min)

**What Happens**:
- Story Architect structures complete narrative
- Three-act breakdown with layered plotting
- Information architecture (what audience learns when)
- Complete narrative circles

**Your Role**:
- Choose structural approach (Ghosh atmospheric vs. Raghavan neo-noir)
- Define key turning points
- Identify revelation moments

**What You'll Define**:
```
- Act 1: Setup, inciting incident, commitment
- Act 2: Rising action, midpoint shift, darkest moment
- Act 3: Climax, resolution (ambiguous or clear?)
- Surface plot vs. hidden plot vs. thematic plot
- Opening image ↔ Closing image (complete circle)
```

**Output**: Complete three-act structure with scene sequence

---

### Phase 5: Master Quality Check #1 (15-20 min)

**What Happens**:
- BMAD-FILM Master reviews story + character work
- Checks coherence between agents
- Flags issues before proceeding to screenplay

**Your Role**:
- Review Master's assessment
- Approve proceeding or request adjustments
- Address any red flags identified

**What's Checked**:
```
✓ Theme is clear and embedded in action
✓ World is established completely
✓ Characters feel real, not constructs
✓ Want vs. need is clear
✓ Moral ambiguity creates tension
✓ Structure has integrity
✓ No contradictions between story and character
```

**Output**: Quality review report with go/no-go decision

---

### Phase 6: Screenplay Structure (60-90 min)

**What Happens**:
- Screenplay Developer translates story into scene-by-scene blueprint
- Every scene validated with "Are you sure?" method
- Visual storytelling prioritized over dialogue exposition

**Your Role**:
- Walk through each major scene
- Confirm scene purposes and necessities
- Think visually (how to show, not tell)

**For Each Scene, You'll Define**:
```
- Location and characters present
- Character goal in THIS scene
- Obstacle preventing goal
- Outcome and turn
- Visual storytelling opportunities
- "Are you sure?" validation (is this necessary?)
```

**Output**: Scene-by-scene outline with visual storytelling notes

---

### Phase 7: Dialogue Craft (45-60 min)

**What Happens**:
- Dialogue Agent establishes character voices
- Writes dialogue for 3-5 key scenes
- Regional authenticity and subtext layers

**Your Role**:
- Define how each character speaks differently
- Consider code-switching (Hindi-English mixing)
- Think about what's NOT said (subtext)

**Voice Elements You'll Define**:
```
- Education level (affects vocabulary)
- Regional accent/dialect
- Cultural background (language mixing patterns)
- Speech patterns and habits
- What they'd NEVER say
```

**Output**: Character voice profiles + key scene dialogue samples

---

### Phase 8: Master Quality Check #2 (15-20 min)

**What Happens**:
- Final integration review across all four agents
- Ensures screenplay and dialogue quality
- Checks complete coherence

**Your Role**:
- Review final quality assessment
- Approve complete package or request final adjustments

**What's Checked**:
```
✓ Every scene has clear purpose
✓ Visual storytelling dominates
✓ Pacing creates engaging rhythm
✓ Each character has distinct voice
✓ Subtext creates layers
✓ Regional authenticity is genuine
✓ All elements cohere into unified vision
```

**Output**: Final quality report with recommendations

---

### Phase 9: Synthesis & Documentation (20-30 min)

**What Happens**:
- Master Agent compiles all outputs into organized package
- Updates film-project-context.md
- Creates production notes

**Your Role**:
- Minimal - agents handle synthesis
- Review final package structure

**Deliverables Created**:
```

## Tips for Best Results

### Do's ✓

- **Be honest about what you don't know** - "I'm not sure yet" is valid
- **Think visually** - Cinema is visual medium
- **Embrace ambiguity** - Grey areas create interesting stories
- **Trust the process** - Deep excavation takes time
- **Ask questions back** - This is collaboration, not interrogation
- **Take breaks** - 4-8 hours is long; split into sessions if needed
- **Read outputs aloud** - Especially dialogue
- **Consider cultural specificity** - Generic is boring

### Don'ts ✗

- **Don't rush** - Quality story development takes time
- **Don't be vague about setting** - "Mumbai" isn't specific enough
- **Don't create perfect heroes** - Moral ambiguity is more interesting
- **Don't ignore world-building** - It's foundation for everything
- **Don't write full screenplay yet** - This is architecture phase
- **Don't skip quality checks** - They catch issues early
- **Don't ignore regional authenticity** - It grounds extraordinary in real

## Troubleshooting

### "My concept is too vague"

**Solution**: That's okay! Story Architect will excavate with you.
- Start with ANY idea ("revenge story", "missing person mystery")
- Answer questions as best you can
- Discovery happens through conversation

### "I don't know the answers to some questions"

**Solution**: Say so! Agents will help you discover answers.
- "I'm not sure yet" is valid response
- Agents will probe different angles to help clarify
- Multiple rounds of questioning are normal

### "Agents' recommendations feel conflicting"

**Solution**: Master Agent will resolve conflicts.
- Agents may have different priorities (expected)
- Master synthesizes and presents options
- You make final creative decisions

### "Process feels too long"

**Solution**: Break into multiple sessions.
- Save progress after any phase
- Resume with `/story-development` (context preserved)
- Typical breakdown: 2-3 sessions of 2-3 hours each

### "I want to change something from earlier phase"

**Solution**: Iteration is built-in.
- Request adjustments at quality checkpoints
- Master Agent coordinates changes across agents
- Context file tracks all iterations

## Next Steps After Story Development

### If Story is Approved

**Pre-Production Workflows**:
```bash
/shot-breakdown      # Visual planning and shot design
/budget-breakdown    # Detailed production budgeting
/schedule-build      # Shooting schedule creation
/casting-session     # Actor selection process
```

### If Story Needs Testing

**Test Before Proceeding**:
1. **Table Read**: Gather actors, read screenplay aloud
2. **Cold Read**: Give to someone unfamiliar, fresh perspective
3. **Feedback Session**: Test with target audience members
4. **Return to `/story-development`** with insights for refinement

### If Story Needs Refinement

**Polish Specific Elements**:
```bash
# Re-run specific agents (coming in future update)
/story-architect     # Adjust narrative structure
/character-designer  # Refine specific characters
/screenplay-developer # Restructure scenes
/dialogue-agent      # Polish dialogue
```

## Philosophy Reminder

> "Cinema is not about right answers. It's about asking questions that linger long after the lights come up. This workflow helps you build worlds so real that impossible things feel inevitable, and design stories so layered that the audience becomes detective, judge, and witness—never quite sure where they stand, and that's exactly where they should be."

Take your time. Trust the process. Build something worthy of Ghosh and Raghavan's legacy.

🎬 **Now go create your story.**
