+**WHY THIS STEP EXISTS:**
+Every scene between two characters is powered by their invisible history,
+their power dynamic, and what's never been said. Character Relations Map
+makes this invisible architecture visible for the dialogue writer, director,
+and shot breakdown specialist. Without it, scenes have surface action but
+no subtext. With it, every scene carries the weight of the entire relationship.
+
+**HARD GATES (Character Relations):**
+- CANNOT start without approved character-bible.md
+- Screenplay CANNOT start without approved character-relations.md
+- Beat Sheet SHOULD read character-relations.md before creating emotional beats

+    - Celebration Song: Emotional release / plot transition
+    - Climax Song: Resolution celebrate karna
+    Which of these apply to THIS story and WHEN?
+Q6. The One Indispensable Song: Kaunsa ek song hai jo film ki soul hai —

+Q2. Approach: Shyam Benegal style (unflinching realism, no compromise)?
+    Govind Nihalani (institutional critique, dark)?
+    Anurag Basu (issue embedded in human story)?
+    Mainstream-accessible (Airlift / Pink style — issue + entertainment)?
+    Or describe what approach this story takes.
+Q3. Thesis vs. Question: Does this film have a THESIS (this is what I believe about the issue)?
+    Or does it raise a QUESTION (here is the complexity, audience decides)?
+    Which is this story? Both approaches are valid — choose consciously.
+
+**B. PROTAGONIST IN SOCIAL CONTEXT (3 questions)**
+Q4. Protagonist's Relationship to Issue: Directly affected victim? Outsider who witnesses?
+    System insider who rebels? Unlikely ally? Person complicit in the system who changes?
+Q5. Why This Protagonist: Kya specific reason hai ki IS character ki story tell karne se
+    THE ISSUE more powerfully visible hota hai? What does this protagonist's position reveal?
+Q6. The Change Arc: Social cinema protagonists often face: fight and succeed? fight and fail but plant seeds?
+    Don't fight (tragedy)? Change personally but not the system?
+    What arc serves this story's truth?
+
+**C. SYSTEM + ANTAGONIST (3 questions)**
+Q7. The System as Antagonist: Kya antagonist ek individual hai ya ek system (institution, society, law)?
+    If system — how is system made visible and specific (not abstract)?
+Q8. Human Face of System: Best social cinema gives the system a human face — someone who
+    enforces the injustice, believes they're right. Who is that person in this story?
+    Are they purely evil or complicit-but-human?
+Q9. Institutional Detail: Social cinema is powerful when specific.
+    Kaunsi ek institutional detail (procedure, rule, practice, document) this story will expose?
+    Specificity makes the abstract real.
+
+**D. EMOTIONAL STRATEGY (3 questions)**
+Q10. Hope Level: Does this film end with hope (change is possible)? Despair (nothing changes)?
+     Ambiguity (change possible but uncertain)? Defiance (even if we lose, we stood up)?
+     Choose consciously — this defines the film's emotional politics.
+Q11. Catharsis Type: Social cinema's catharsis — anger (audience leaves outraged)?
+     Grief (audience leaves sad but aware)?
+     Inspiration (audience leaves wanting to act)?
+     Complexity (audience leaves unsettled, thinking)?
+Q12. Personal vs. Political: Kya social issue is story mein protagonist ke PERSONAL wound se
+     connected hai? Best social cinema makes the political personal.
+     Kya connection hai is protagonist ke personal story aur social issue ke beech?
+
+**E. SOCIAL CINEMA-SPECIFIC ELEMENTS (3 questions)**
+Q13. Research Authenticity: Kya real events, real places, real institutional processes use honge?
+     Or fictional but realistic? How much documentation/research is built into the world?
+Q14. Avoiding Savior Narrative: Social cinema ka common failure — outsider "saves" marginalized people.
+     Is this story avoiding that trap? How? Who drives their own liberation?
+Q15. The Uncomfortable Truth: Kya ek cheez hai is film mein jo audience ko uncomfortable karega —
+     kyunki it implicates them too? (Not just "bad people are bad" but "we are all complicit somehow")
+     Kya hai woh uncomfortable truth?
+
+**SOCIAL CINEMA QUALITY GATES:**
+- [ ] Issue is specific (not abstract "corruption is bad" but THIS specific corrupt practice)
+- [ ] Protagonist's personal stake makes social issue emotionally real
+- [ ] System has a human face (not cartoon evil)
+- [ ] Resolution is honest (not convenient triumph)
+- [ ] Uncomfortable truth implicates audience, not just distant "bad people"

+### 🔴 Story Element Processing Passes (MANDATORY — Run Before Story Creation at STEP 9)
+
+**PASS 1 — ANTI-PATTERN FILTER (OUTPUT TO USER — MANDATORY):**
+Is story ki 3 sabse predictable versions internally identify karo.
+Phir inhe USER KO DIKHAO — story likhne se PEHLE. Yeh step skip nahi hoga.
+
+**USER KO DIKHAO (MANDATORY FORMAT):**
+```
+Is story ke teen sabse predictable versions jo main NAHI likh raha:
+
+❌ Version 1: [Generic version — 1-2 lines, writer ke genre/concept se directly related]
+❌ Version 2: [Generic version — 1-2 lines, alag angle se]
+❌ Version 3: [Generic version — 1-2 lines, ek aur common trap]
+
+Yeh teeno avoid kiye gaye hain. Ab 4th version likh raha hoon.
+```
+
+Phir internally "4th version" dhundho — unexpected but earned by writer's own answers.
+Check: "Yeh story ka core kisi aur film jaisa toh nahi?" → Yes = rethink approach.
+
+**PASS 2 — ELEMENT BALANCE CHECK (Relationship as Engine):**
+Story mein kya drive kar raha hai — PLOT ya RELATIONSHIP+EMOTION?
+- Agar PLOT drive kar raha hai → reverse engineer: relationship decision se plot nikaalte hain
+- Har major plot point trace karo: "Yeh kisi character ki emotional state ya relationship dynamic se kyun ho raha hai?"
+- Characters ki relationships se CONFLICT EMERGE honi chahiye — plot pehle nahi, relationship pehle
+- Subtext layer: Har dialogue mein — jo kaha gaya + jo nahi kaha gaya + jo chahte hain = teeno alag hone chahiye
+
+**PASS 3 — SPECIFICITY DRILL (Generic → Cinematic):**
+Har story element ko hyper-specific banao BEFORE writing:
+- Generic world → ek specific smell, ek specific sound, ek ajeeb local detail only HERE
+- Generic conflict → exact moment, exact word, exact silence jab sab toot gaya
+- Generic character → ek contradiction, ek habit, ek thing they do when alone
+Test: "Kya koi isko kisi aur story mein copy kar sakta hai?" → Yes = aur specific karo
+
+**PASS 4 — EMOTIONAL SUBVERSION MAP:**
+Har major scene mein map karo: audience EXPECTS kya feel karna?
+Ab deliver karo: Unexpected version — earned, not random.
+- Expected: Big confrontation scene → Deliver: Silence, ek sentence, phir walk away
+- Expected: Victory → Deliver: Victory + loss of what they were really fighting for
+- Expected: Tearful goodbye → Deliver: Practical conversation, emotion in one small gesture
+Goal: "Unforgettable" — ek unexpected emotional dhakka jo audience ko surprise kare par SAHI bhi lage
+
+**PASS 5 — "ONLY THIS STORY" TEST:**
+Har plot point check karo: "Kya yeh EXACT moment kisi aur film mein alag characters ke saath ho sakta tha?"
+Agar YES → Rewrite until it couldn't happen anywhere else.
+Har moment IRREPLACEABLE hona chahiye — characters ki specific psychology + world ka specific pressure = unique moment.
+Yeh test fail karna = generic story. Yeh test pass karna = cinema worth making.

 ### Dialogue Level (Hindi/Hinglish)
 ✅ **Naturalism**: How real people in that context would speak
 ✅ **Character Voice**: Each character has distinct speech patterns

+description: |
+  **MICRO DRAMA DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM** — Compressed architecture for short-episode series.
+
+  **Core Rules of Micro Drama Storytelling:**
+
+  EPISODE = ONE EMOTIONAL BEAT. Not a full story.
+  Every episode delivers ONE feeling, ONE relationship moment, ONE revelation.
+  That's it. Everything else serves this one thing.
+
+  DIALOGUE IS PRIMARY. In 3-7 minutes, you cannot afford breathing room.
+  Every line must do double duty: advance plot AND reveal character.
+  Silence is expensive. Use it only for maximum impact.
+
+  WORLD = INSTANTLY RECOGNIZABLE. No setup allowed.
+  Episode 1 must establish world in 60 seconds.
+  Episodes 2+ assume audience knows the world.
+
+  ONE RELATIONSHIP = THE WHOLE SERIES. Every episode is about this relationship
+  at a different moment. The relationship IS the story.
+
+  SUBTEXT IS THE EPISODE. What's NOT said = what the episode is actually about.
+  In 5 minutes, there's no time to approach the real subject directly.
+  The real subject lives in the gaps.
+
+  **8 Story Elements — Micro Drama Treatment:**
+
+  CHARACTER: One trait revealed per episode (not full arc). Character is shown
+  through ACTION only — no time for backstory.
+
+  RELATIONSHIP: ONE core relationship — this IS the series. Every episode
+  explores one moment in this relationship's evolution.
+
+  EMOTION: Single emotion per episode. Punchy. Immediate. Audience feels it
+  within 60 seconds and it stays with them after the episode ends.
+
+  PLOT: One scene = one beat = one episode. No B-story. No subplot.
+  Everything serves the episode's ONE moment.
+
+  WORLD: Instantly recognizable with ONE specific twist that makes it this
+  world and no other. Established in Episode 1, assumed from Episode 2.
+
+  CONFLICT: Compressed. One line establishes the conflict.
+  Everything else is the collision.
+
+  THEME: Never stated. Only felt. Emerges from ALL episodes combined —
+  no single episode carries the theme alone.
+
+  SUBTEXT: IS the episode. What is not said in 3-7 minutes is what the episode
+  is about. The title, the scene choice, the dialogue — all point to the unsaid.

+      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
+      ```
+
+      **Format Questions (ask first):**
+
+      MF1. "Kitne episodes banane hain? (10 / 20 / 30 / 50 / doosra)"
+      MF2. "Ek episode kitna lamba hoga? (2-3 min / 3-5 min / 5-7 min)"
+      MF3. "Platform kaun sa? (YouTube Shorts / Instagram Reels / OTT / Television)"
+      MF4. "Format vertical hai (phone ke liye 9:16) ya horizontal (16:9)?"
+
+      **CONCEPT MINING (Before Seeds — Mandatory):**
+      Writer ke concept mein se 3-5 threads nikalo. Jo unhone kaha — literally unke words use karo.
+      "Tumne [X] kaha — yeh interesting hai. Aur [Y] mention kiya..."
+      Tab seeds shuru karo.
+
+      **40/60 MODEL: Writer 10 deep seeds deta hai (Micro Drama ke liye compressed).**
+      **AI 60% series architecture un seeds se banata hai.**
+      Ek seed at a time. Main Q → jawab lo → Depth Probe → jawab lo → next seed.
+      Depth Probe skip karna FORBIDDEN. Micro drama mein words kam hain —
+      isliye har depth probe AUR zyada zaroori hai.
+
+      **GROUP 1 — CORE + RELATIONSHIP (MS1–MS5)**
+
+      MS1. KHINCHAV + PEHLI IMAGE (Origin + Visual in One)
+           Main Q: "Yeh series kab se hai tumhare andar? Aur is series ka woh ek image
+           jo tumhe nahi chhodta — Episode 1 ka. Describe karo exactly."
+           Depth Probe: "Woh image mein light kaisi hai — andhera zyada ya roshni?
+           Koi sound hai ya khamoshi? Aur yeh real se connected hai kya — koi memory?"
+
+      MS2. CORE RELATIONSHIP (The Whole Series)
+           Main Q: "Yeh ek relationship ki story hai.
+           Kaun hai woh do log? Officially kya hain — actually kya hain?"
+           Depth Probe: "Pehli baar jab yeh dono mile — exactly kya feel hua?
+           Aur ek cheez batao jo in dono ne kabhi same direction mein nahi dekhi."
+
+      MS3. THE UNSAID (Series Engine)
+           Main Q: "Is relationship mein ek cheez hai jo kabhi nahi kahi gayi.
+           Agar yeh cheez ek baar kahi gayi — series khatam hogi. Woh kya hai?"
+           Depth Probe: "Agar yeh unsaid cheez sirf ek sentence mein kahi jaaye —
+           kaun kehta hai, aur kab? Poori series mein kaunsa episode sabse close aata hai
+           is sentence ke? Kahi jaayegi final episode mein — ya phir bhi nahi?"
+
+      MS4. WORLD + CONSTRAINT (Setting as Character)
+           Main Q: "Yeh story kahan hoti hai?
+           Ek sentence mein — jaise koi 5 second mein picture mein dekhe."
+           Depth Probe: "Is world ka ek aisa rule ya pressure hai jo yeh do log mahsoos karte hain
+           — jo unhe rok ke rakhta hai. Exactly kya hai woh rule?
+           Aur is world mein ek cheez hai jo SIRF IS WORLD MEIN HAI — koi aur jagah mein nahi.
+           Woh kya hai?"
+
+      MS5. CHARACTER WOUNDS (Who They Really Are)
+           Main Q: "Pehle character ko ek word mein describe karo.
+           Doosre character ko ek word mein describe karo."
+           Depth Probe: "Pehle character ka woh wound — kab se hai? Koi ek moment jab woh hurt hua.
+           Doosra character — woh wound jaanta hai ya nahi?
+           Yeh jaanna/na jaanna hi relationship ki core dynamic hai."
+
+      **GROUP 2 — ARC + TONE (MS6–MS10)**
+
+      MS6. EMOTIONAL JOURNEY (Start to End)
+           Main Q: "Is series mein emotions ka range kya hai?
+           Episode 1 mein audience kya feel karta hai — final episode ke baad kya feel karta hai?"
+           Depth Probe: "Woh emotional journey — tumhari khud ki zindagi mein kisi cheez se
+           connected hai? Koi baar tumhe yeh exact transition aayi thi?"
+
+      MS7. AAKHRI IMAGE + EPISODE 1 CONTRAST (Resolution)
+           Main Q: "Series ka aakhri episode — last image. Kaun hai frame mein, kya ho raha hai?"
+           Depth Probe: "Episode 1 ki pehli image (MS1) se yeh last image kaise different hai?
+           Series mein kya badla — woh difference is image mein kaise dikhta hai?
+           Protagonist akela hai ya saath — aur presence ya absence kyun?"
+
+      MS8. FEEL REFERENCE (Hyper-Specific Tone)
+           Main Q: "Koi ek film ya series jis ki FEEL tumhari series se milti hai —
+           story nahi, sirf feel."
+           Depth Probe: "Us film mein ek specific scene jo us feel ko best represent karta hai —
+           woh 2-3 minute ka scene describe karo."
+
+      MS9. JO BILKUL NAHI CHAHIYE (Anti-Cliché Guard)
+           Main Q: "Ek cheez jo is series mein tum definitely NAHI chahte —
+           koi cliché, koi trope, koi familiar pattern."
+           Depth Probe: "Agar woh cheez accidentally aa jaaye —
+           audience ko exactly kya feel hoga jo tum NAHI chahte? Woh feeling batao."
+
+      MS10. SUBTEXT + HOOK + FORMAT (Micro-Specific)
+            Main Q: "Ek cheez jo poori series mein kabhi directly nahi kahi jaayegi
+            par neeche behti rahegi. Kitne episodes? Platform kaun sa?"
+            Depth Probe: "Woh subtext — ek sentence mein kya hai jo audience samjhe
+            poori series dekhne ke baad?
+            Woh hook jo har episode ke end mein audience ko next episode tak kheenche —
+            kaunsa type? Aur is platform pe audience kis mood mein watch karta hai?"
+
+      **MANDATORY RULES:**
+      1. Concept Mining PEHLE — seeds baad mein
+      2. Depth Probe MANDATORY har seed ke baad — skip strictly forbidden
+      3. Ek seed at a time — Main Q + Probe + phir next seed
+      4. Koi option mat do — khule sawal only
+      5. Micro drama = 3-7 min episodes. Seeds compress hain par depth SAME hai.

+
+      **PURPOSE: Writer ke 10 micro seeds se AI puri SERIES architecture propose karta hai.**
+
+      **STEP 1: PASS 0 — SEED TRACEABILITY (run internally before showing user)**
+      Har proposed element ke liye check karo: "Yeh kaunse seed se aaya?"
+
+      Seed → What it drives at SERIES level:
+      - MS1 (khinchav + image + real origin) → Series emotional reason + visual grammar
+      - MS2 (core pair + first meeting + divergence) → Relationship DNA
+      - MS3 (unsaid + sentence + episode + said/not-said) → Subtext engine across episodes
+      - MS4 (world + rule + unique detail) → Setting as character, world constraint
+      - MS5 (words + wounds + known/unknown) → Character psychology, relationship dynamic
+      - MS6 (emotion start → end + personal connect) → Series emotional arc
+      - MS7 (last image + MS1 contrast) → Series arc, transformation proof
+      - MS8 (feel reference + specific scene) → Tone, pacing, episode rhythm
+      - MS9 (what not to have + feeling to avoid) → Anti-pattern map
+      - MS10 (subtext + hook + format) → Originality layer, episode engine, platform strategy
+
+      RULE: Koi bhi proposed element bina seed se trace kiye nahi rahega.
+            Agar trace nahi hota → AI generic default hai → HATA DO.
+
+      **STEP 2: GENERATE SERIES ARCHITECTURE — then USER KO DIKHAO:**

+
+      CHARACTER PSYCHOLOGY:
+      → Character 1 wound (kab se, kya hua): [AI proposal] — from MS5 depth probe
+      → Character 2 — knows the wound?: [AI proposal] — from MS5 depth probe

+      ```
+
+      **BEFORE WRITING BIBLE — 3 MANDATORY PASSES:**
+
+      **PASS 0 — SEED TRACEABILITY FINAL CHECK (Run FIRST):**
+      Bible ka final version likhne se pehle — har element trace karo:
+      - Core relationship dynamic → MS2 depth probe (first meeting + divergence)? Agar nahi → REWRITE
+      - Character wound → MS5 depth probe (moment + known/unknown)? Agar nahi → REWRITE
+      - The unsaid sentence → MS3 depth probe? Agar nahi → REWRITE
+      - World rule + unique detail → MS4 depth probe? Agar nahi → REWRITE
+      - Series arc (start → end images) → MS1 + MS7 depth probe? Agar nahi → REWRITE
+      - Subtext current → MS10 subtext sentence? Agar nahi → REWRITE
+      ZERO TOLERANCE: Koi bhi untraced element = generic AI default = hatao.
+
+      **PASS 1 — ANTI-PATTERN FILTER (OUTPUT TO USER — MANDATORY):**
+      Is micro series ki 3 sabse predictable versions identify karo.
+      Phir inhe USER KO DIKHAO — Bible likhne se PEHLE.
+
+      **USER KO DIKHAO (MANDATORY FORMAT):**
+      ```
+      Is series ke teen sabse predictable versions jo main NAHI likh raha:
+
+      ❌ Version 1: [Generic micro drama version — 1-2 lines, relationship/genre se related]
+      ❌ Version 2: [Generic version — alag common pattern]
+      ❌ Version 3: [Generic version — ek aur familiar trap]
+
+      Yeh teeno avoid kiye gaye hain. Ab 4th version ki Bible likh raha hoon.
+      ```
+
+      **DIVERGE BEFORE CONVERGE (MANDATORY — before Bible is written):**
+      3 genuinely different series directions writer ke OWN seeds se:
+
+      ```
+      Tumhare seeds mein teen alag micro series directions dikh rahi hain:
+
+      🔵 Direction A — [Series direction — from MS1 image + MS7 final image contrast]
+         [Writer's specific seed that generates this direction]
+         Series Feel: [Dark/Quiet/Tense — 1-2 words]
+
+      🟡 Direction B — [Series direction — from MS2/MS3 relationship + unsaid]
+         [Writer's specific seed that generates this direction]
+         Series Feel: [1-2 words]
+
+      🔴 Direction C — [Series direction — from MS10 subtext + MS9 avoidance]
+         [Writer's specific seed that generates this direction]
+         Series Feel: [1-2 words]
+
+      Kaunsa series sabse tumhari lagti hai?

+
+      ## CORE RELATIONSHIP
+      *Yeh ek relationship ki story hai. Series ka har episode is relationship
+      ka ek moment hai.*
+
+      **Relationship Type (Official):** [Brother/Sister, Boss/Employee, etc.]
+      **Relationship Type (Actual):** [What they really are to each other]
+      **History:** [What happened before Episode 1 that still lives in every scene]
+      **Power Dynamic:** [Who holds power — does it shift? When?]
+      **The Unsaid:** [THE thing never said — if said, series ends]
+      **Subtext Signature:** [The recurring gesture/word/silence carrying their history]
+
+      ---
+
+      ## EMOTIONAL ARC MAP
+      *Kya feel karega audience — episode 1 se episode [X] tak.*
+
+      **Episode 1 Emotion:** [What audience feels after Ep 1]
+      **Arc Direction:** [How emotions evolve — escalating tension / slow burn / alternating / etc.]
+      **Mid-Series Emotion:** [What audience feels at midpoint]
+      **Final Episode Emotion:** [What audience is left with after final episode]
+      **The Full Journey:** [One sentence describing the complete emotional experience]
+
+      ---
+
+      ## THE UNSAID (Series-Level)
+      *Jo kabhi nahi kaha jaayega — ya sirf aakhir mein.*
+
+      **What it is:** [The thing never directly addressed]
+      **How it shows up:** [Which moments it comes closest to being said]
+      **Does it get said?** [In final episode — yes/no/almost]
+      **If yes — what happens after?** [Series-ending moment]

+
+      ## PLATFORM NOTES
+      **Platform:** [YouTube Shorts / Instagram / OTT]
+      **Format:** [Vertical 9:16 / Horizontal 16:9]
+      **First 3 Seconds:** [What must happen in first 3 seconds to stop scrolling]
+      **Episode Thumbnail Strategy:** [What makes audience click]
+
+      ## DIALOGUE ECONOMY LAW
+      *Micro drama mein dialogue IS the story. Har line double duty kare.*
+
+      **RULE 1 — DOUBLE DUTY MANDATORY:**
+      Har line do cheezein ek saath kare — plot advance + character reveal.
+      ✅ "Khaana thanda ho gaya." = Time passed (plot) + She stopped caring to warm it (character)
+      ❌ "Khaana thanda ho gaya kyunki main bahut busy tha." = Explanation only — single duty
+
+      **RULE 2 — APPROACH SIDEWAYS:**
+      Real subject ko directly mat kaho. Character always talks about something else.
+      Real subject: "Main tumse pyaar karta hoon."
+      What character says: "Tum aaj bhi wahi shirt pehnti ho." ✅
+
+      **RULE 3 — SILENCE IS EXPENSIVE:**
+      Silence = 10 seconds minimum in a 3-min episode = 6% of runtime.
+      Use ONLY at maximum impact. Cheap silence = leaked time.
+
+      **RULE 4 — NO EXPOSITION:**
+      Characters know their own world. They don't explain it to each other.
+      ❌ "Jab se papa ne zameen bech di..." (exposition)
+      ✅ "Zameen ki baat mat karo." (implies history, creates curiosity)
+
+      **Episode QA**: Before finalizing any episode — "Is har line ka double duty hai?"
+
+      ---
+
+      ## AI VISUAL CHARACTER SEEDS
+      *For AI video generation — naam nahi, visual anchors. Consistency is everything.*
+
+      ### [CHARACTER 1 NAME] — AI Visual Seed:
+      **Age + Build:** [e.g., "28 saal, medium height, slim build"]
+      **Hair:** [e.g., "Shoulder-length dark hair, slight wave, no accessories"]
+      **Face:** [e.g., "Oval face, large dark eyes, slightly full lips"]
+      **Clothing Anchor:** [e.g., "White cotton kurta + blue jeans — STAYS CONSISTENT across episodes"]
+      **Default Expression:** [e.g., "Pensive with slight tension at jaw"]
+      **Voice Tone (Veo3):** [e.g., "Soft, measured — when she raises voice, it's significant"]
+
+      ### [CHARACTER 2 NAME] — AI Visual Seed:
+      **Age + Build:** [...]
+      **Hair:** [...]
+      **Face:** [...]
+      **Clothing Anchor:** [STAYS CONSISTENT — document any planned costume change in Episode Arc Map]
+      **Default Expression:** [...]
+      **Voice Tone (Veo3):** [...]
+
+      **AI CONSISTENCY RULE:** Clothing anchor = character continuity anchor.
+      Every AI prompt must include FULL visual description — not just name.
+      Costume change = story beat (planned) OR continuity error (unplanned).

+      Episodes: [X to X] | The situation: [...]
+
+      PHASE 3 — First Genuine Connection (Ep ~30% to ~45%):
+      "Woh ek moment — jahan dono ke liye reality shift hoti hai. First crack in the wall."
+      Episodes: [X to X] | The crack: [...]
+
+      PHASE 4 — Separation Threat (Ep ~45% to ~55%):
+      "Koi third party, koi decision, koi past — jo inhe wapas alag karne ki koshish karta hai."
+      Episodes: [X to X] | The threat: [...]
+
+      PHASE 5 — The Major Revelation (~55% to ~70%):
+      "Woh cheez jo sab kuch recontextualize kare — about one of them, about their past."
+      Episodes: [X to X] | The revelation: [...]
+
+      PHASE 6 — Final Obstacle (~70% to ~85%):
+      "Last biggest wall — jo lagta hai insurmountable hai."
+      Episodes: [X to X] | The obstacle: [...]
+
+      PHASE 7 — Resolution (~85% to 100%):
+      "Unsaid — kahi jaati hai ya nahi? Series ka full circle moment."
+      Episodes: [X to X] | Resolution: [Does unsaid get said? Yes/No/Almost]
+
+      ---
+
+      **PAYWALL ENGINEERING (Indian platforms — Episodes 10-15):**
+
+      PAYWALL EPISODE: Episode [10-15 — designate exact number]
+
+      Paywall episode MUST have:
+      1. Series ka MAXIMUM TENSION moment — relationship at breaking point OR breakthrough
+      2. "The Unsaid" (MS3) — is episode mein sabse CLOSE aata hai kehne ke
+      3. One character decision audience CANNOT predict
+      4. Episode ends WITHOUT resolution — paid content resolves this
+
+      Question: "Kaunsa episode pe audience ZAROOR next episode dekhna chahegi — even if they have to pay?"
+      → That episode = paywall episode.
+
+      RULE: Paywall episode = non-negotiable quality gate.
+      Weak paywall episode → series won't convert free viewers to paid.

+  - "Micro-recap ek line — zyada nahi, kam nahi. Jo audience ne miss kiya ho woh recap nahi — jo zaroori hai woh recap"
+  - "Hook = question + emotion. Sirf mystery ya sirf emotion — dono nahi chalega"
+  - "The Unsaid protect karo. Agar kisi episode mein directly bol diya — series khatam ho gayi"
+
+philosophy: |
+  Micro Drama ka magic yeh hai ki bahut kam time mein bahut zyada feel hota hai.
+
+  3 minute mein ek emotion. 5 minute mein ek relationship shift.
+  7 minute mein ek moment jo audience ko raat bhar sochata rakhey.
+
+  Yeh possible hai sirf ek tarike se — subtext.
+  Jo characters NAHI bolte, woh hi story hai.
+  Jo screen pe NAHI dikhta, woh hi emotion hai.
+
+  Har episode ek iceberg hai.
+  Audience sirf upar wala hissa dekhti hai —
+  lekin neeche ki feeling unhe kheenchti rehti hai, episode darvaaza band karne ke baad bhi.
+
+  Yeh "unsaid" — yahi micro drama ka asli hero hai.
+  Use protect karo. Use respect karo. Aur sahi waqt pe, sirf sahi waqt pe — use kehne do.

-      *Yeh phase samjhata hai ki writer is story ki taraf KYUN khinch raha hai.*
+      **GROUP 1 — WHY + CORE (Seeds S1–S4)**
+
+      S1. KHINCHAV (Personal Origin)
+          Main Q: "Yeh story kab se hai tumhare andar? Kya cheez baar baar kheenchti hai is taraf?"
+          Depth Probe: "Woh exact moment kya tha jab yeh story pehli baar aayi — koi cheez dekhi,
+          suni, ya mehsoos ki? Koi real se connected hai kuch is mein?"
+          [AI gets: personal origin — only THIS writer can write this story. Irreplaceable specificity.]
+
+      S2. PEHLI IMAGE (Visual DNA)
+          Main Q: "Aankhein band karo. Is story ka woh ek image jo tumhe nahi chhodta —
+          ek frame, ek moment. Abhi describe karo."
+          Depth Probe: "Us frame mein light kahan se aa rahi hai — andhera zyada hai ya roshni?
+          Aur woh image silent hai ya koi awaaz hai usme?"
+          [AI gets: visual grammar + tone temperature + sound palette. World uniquely built.]
+
+      S3. AAKHRI EHSAAS (Emotional Destination)
+          Main Q: "Film khatam hoti hai, audience bahar nikal rahi hai — exactly kya feel
+          ho raha hai unhe? Woh ek emotion ya thought jo unke andar reh jaaye."
+          Depth Probe: "Yeh feeling — kya tumhari khud ki zindagi mein kisi cheez se connected
+          hai? Koi baar tumhe yeh exact feeling aayi thi?"
+          [AI gets: story's emotional destination + thematic resonance + personal truth.]
+
+      S4. JO KEHNA MUSHKIL HAI (Core Uncomfortable Truth)
+          Main Q: "Is story mein koi dark ya uncomfortable angle hai — koi truth jo kehna
+          zaroori hai lekin mushkil lagta hai? Kya hai woh?"
+          Depth Probe: "Agar tum yeh nahi kehte is story mein — story kya missing ho jaayegi?
+          Exactly woh kya hai jo sirf yeh story keh sakti hai?"
+          [AI gets: thematic core + why story MUST be told + irreplaceable distinction.]
 
-      Q1. KHINCHAV:
-          "Yeh story tumhare dimaag mein kab se hai? Aur kya cheez hai is mein jo tumhe
-          baar baar wapas kheenchti hai — koi personal connection, koi cheez jo tumne
-          dekhi, koi sawaal jo tumhare andar unsolved hai?"
-
-      Q2. PEHLI IMAGE:
-          "Aankhein band karo ek second. Is story ka koi ek scene ya moment hai jo
-          tumhare dimaag mein clearly dikh raha hai — ek image, ek chehra, ek jagah.
-          Kya dikh raha hai? Describe karo — aisa jaise koi painting ho."
-
-      Q3. AUDIENCE KA AAKHRI EHSAAS:
-          "Film khatam hoti hai. Audience cinema se bahar nikal rahi hai. Unhe kuch
-          feel ho raha hai — woh exactly kya hai? Sirf ek emotion, ek thought —
-          jo tum chahte ho unke andar reh jaaye."
-
-      Q4. JO KEHNA MUSHKIL HAI:
-          "Is story mein koi cheez hai jo tumhe thodi uncomfortable karti hai —
-          koi dark truth, koi complex cheez, koi angle jo typical nahi hai —
-          lekin phir bhi tumhe lagta hai kehna zaroori hai? Kya hai woh?"
+      ---
 
-      Q5. KISKE LIYE:
-          "Yeh story kiske liye hai? Koi ek insaan — real ya imaginary — jiske
-          liye tum yeh bana rahe ho. Woh kaun hai?"
+      **GROUP 2 — WHO + RELATIONSHIP (Seeds S5–S8)**
+
+      S5. CHAHNA AUR ZAROORAT (Character Psychology + Want vs Need Gap)
+          Main Q: "Tumhara main character kya CHAHTA hai — jo dikhta hai? Aur unhe kya ZAROORI hai — jo unhe khud bhi pata nahi?"
+          Depth Probe 1: "Woh 'zaroori' cheez — kab se hai unke andar? Koi ek moment
+          jab woh need shuru hui — kya hua tha tab?"
+          Depth Probe 2 (WANT vs NEED GAP — MANDATORY):
+          "Protagonist ka WANT kya hai — woh kya KARTE HAIN? (External goal — dikhta hai)
+          Aur unka NEED kya hai — woh kya HONA CHAHIYE? (Internal — jo unhe khud pata nahi)
+          Kya dono ALAG hain? Agar same hain — yeh flat arc hai. Restate until they diverge.
+          RULE: Story ka plot = mechanism jo protagonist ko Want aur Need ke beech choose karwata hai."
+          [AI gets: character wound origin + arc direction + full psychological depth.]
+
+      S6. SABSE IMPORTANT RISHTA (Relationship DNA)
+          Main Q: "Is story ka sabse important rishta kaun sa hai — woh do log
+          jinke beech jo hoga, woh hi story ka asli dil hoga?"
+          Depth Probe: "Jab dono pehli baar milte hain — exactly kya feel hota hai?
+          Aur ek cheez batao jo un dono ne kabhi same direction mein nahi dekhi."
+          [AI gets: relationship baseline + subtext origin + defining dynamic.]
+
+      S7. JO KABHI NAHI KAHA GAYA (Subtext Engine)
+          Main Q: "Un dono ke beech woh unsaid cheez kya hai jo har scene mein
+          hawa mein rehti hai — jo kabhi seedha nahi kaha gaya?"
+          Depth Probe: "Agar woh unsaid cheez kabhi sirf ek sentence mein keh di jaaye —
+          kya hoga? Kaunsi conversation yeh do log kabhi nahi kar sakte?"
+          [AI gets: exact subtext sentence + relationship tension + what every scene carries beneath.]
+
+      S8. WOH EK DECISION (Structural Spine)
+          Main Q: "Ek choice — sirf ek — jo sab kuch badal deti hai. Kya hai woh?"
+          Depth Probe: "Woh exact moment mein protagonist kahan hai — akela hai ya koi
+          saath hai? Kaunsi ek cheez dekh, sun, ya feel karke woh decision lete hain?"
+          [AI gets: story pivot + cinematic specificity + cause-effect chain. Spine locked.]
+
+      S8a. INTERVAL SEED (Movie format only — skip for Short Film/Web/Micro)
+           Main Q: "Interval pe story kahaan hogi? Audience wapas aane se pehle —
+           unke haath mein woh kya hoga jo unhe screen ki taraf kheenche?
+           Koi cliffhanger, revelation, ya decision point jo resolve nahi hua?"
+           Depth Probe: "Is interval moment ke baad audience theatre se uthte hue —
+           exactly kya feel kar rahe honge? Anxiety? Dread? Hope? Betrayal?
+           Woh exact emotion batao jo half-time mein unke saath baahir jaayega."

-      *Yeh phase character ko andar se samjhta hai — surface se nahi.*
+      **GROUP 3 — LANDING + TONE (Seeds S9–S12)**
+
+      S9. AAKHRI IMAGE (Resolution)
+          Main Q: "Film ka last scene — tumhare dimaag mein ek image.
+          Kaun hai frame mein, kya ho raha hai?"
+          Depth Probe: "Pehli image (S2) se yeh last image kaise different hai?
+          Protagonist akela hai ya koi saath hai — aur woh presence ya absence kyun?"
+          [AI gets: full arc S2→S9 + transformation logic + resolution emotional state.]
+
+      S10. FEEL REFERENCE (Hyper-Specific Tone)
+          Main Q: "Koi ek film jis ki FEEL tumhare story se milti hai — story nahi,
+          sirf feel, texture, energy. Kaunsi film?"
+          Depth Probe: "Us film mein ek specific scene jo us feel ko best represent
+          karta hai — woh 2-3 minute ka scene describe karo."
+          [AI gets: not genre label but exact texture, pacing, emotional temperature.]
+
+      S11. JO BILKUL NAHI CHAHIYE (Anti-Cliché Guard)
+          Main Q: "Ek cheez jo is story mein tum definitely NAHI chahte — koi
+          cliché, koi trope, koi moment."
+          Depth Probe: "Agar woh cheez accidentally aa jaaye — audience ko exactly
+          kya feel hoga jo tum NAHI chahte? Woh feeling batao."
+          [AI gets: anti-pattern material with emotional reasoning — what to reject and WHY.]
+
+      S12. OUT OF THE BOX + SUBTEXT (Uniqueness + Hidden Layer)
+          Main Q: "Kuch aisa jo typically is genre mein nahi hota — unexpected element.
+          Aur: koi ek cheez jo story mein kabhi directly nahi kahi jaayegi par neeche behti rahegi."
+          Depth Probe: "Woh 'out of box' element kahan se aaya — koi real cheez, koi memory?
+          Aur agar audience ne poori film dekhi aur woh hidden current feel ki —
+          woh ek sentence mein kya samjhe jo film ne kabhi nahi kaha?"
+          [AI gets: originality anchor with real-world origin + thematic subtext in one sentence to weave throughout.]
 
-      Q6. PEHLI NAZAR:
-          "Apna main character close your eyes karke dekho. Describe karo —
-          kya pehna hua hai, kaise chalta hai, koi ek kaam jo woh karta hai
-          jab koi nahi dekh raha. Sirf woh image batao."
+      ---
 
-      Q7. CHAAHAT AUR ZAROORAT:
-          "Tumhara protagonist kya CHAHTA hai — woh cheez jo woh bol sake,
-          jo clearly dikhti hai? Aur phir — woh actually kya ZAROORI hai
-          uske liye jo shayad use khud bhi pata nahi?"
+      **SCALE-ADAPTIVE — Kitne seeds poochho:**
+      - 30-sec microdrama: S1, S2, S3, S6 (4 seeds + their probes)
+      - 5-min short: S1-S4, S6, S8, S9, S11 (8 seeds + their probes)
+      - Feature / Series: All 12 seeds + depth probes + follow-ups on rich answers
 
-      Q8. CHHUPI SHARM:
-          "Is character ka ek raaz hai — koi aisi cheez jo isse sharm aati hai,
-          ya jo usne kabhi kisi ko nahi bataya. Woh kya hai?
-          (Yeh story mein directly aana zaroori nahi — bas tum jaano.)"
+      ---
 
-      Q9. BADLAAV:
-          "Story ke end mein yeh insaan pehle se alag hai. Andar kuch toot gaya
-          ya ban gaya. Kya change hua? Woh pehle kya tha, aur ab kya hai?"
+      **MANDATORY RULES:**
+      1. **CONCEPT MINING PEHLE** — structured seeds baad mein. Rule kabhi skip nahi.
+      2. **Depth Probe MANDATORY** — har seed ke baad depth probe poochho. Surface answer nahi chalega.
+      3. **Ek baar mein 1 seed + 1 probe** — writer ko breathe karne do.
+      4. **Koi option mat do** — khule sawal. "A, B, C mein se choose karo" strictly forbidden.
+      5. **Follow-up karo** — rich answer mila toh ek extra probe karo.
+      6. **Har group ke baad summarize** — "Yeh main samjha — sahi hai?"
+      7. **"Pata nahi"** = "Theek hai, chhodo, aage chalte hain."
+      8. **NEVER suggest** — sirf seeds extract karo. AI baad mein banayega.
+
+      **Collect ALL 12 seeds + depth probe answers. Tab Step 1b (AI Architecture Proposal) shuru karo.**
+    duration: "20-30 min"
 
-      Q10. GALAT JO SAHI THA:
-          "Ek moment batao — ya soch ke banao — jab tumhare protagonist ne kuch
-          aisa kiya jo logon ko galat lagta, lekin uske liye woh bilkul sahi tha.
-          Kyon woh decision liya usne?"

+    agent: "master-story-director-interactive"
+    action: |
+      **PURPOSE: Writer ke 12 deep seeds se AI puri story architecture propose karta hai.**
+      **Yeh AI ka 60% creative contribution hai — seeds ke bahar expand karna.**
 
-      ---
+      **STEP 1: PASS 0 — SEED TRACEABILITY (run internally before showing user)**
 
-      **PHASE C: DUNIYA AUR MAHOL (4 questions) — WHERE does this live?**
-      *Writer ki duniya ko feel karo — sirf location nahi, atmosphere.*
+      Har proposed element ke liye check karo: "Yeh kaunse seed se aaya?"
 
-      Q11. JAGAH KI ROOH:
-          "Story ki main jagah mein tum khade ho — aankhein band. Batao:
-          wahan kaisi smell hai? Kaisi awaaz? Kitni roshni? Kya feel hota hai
-          us jagah mein khade hoke — calm, dar, energy, udaasi, kuch aur?"
+      Seed → What it drives:
+      - S1 (khinchav + real origin) → protagonist's emotional reason + personal wound
+      - S2 (first image + light/sound) → visual grammar, world opening, defining image
+      - S3 (last feeling + personal connection) → resolution tone, thematic resonance
+      - S4 (uncomfortable truth + what's missing without it) → thematic core, story's purpose
+      - S5 (want/need + wound origin moment) → character psychology, arc cause
+      - S6 (relationship + first meeting feel + divergent direction) → relationship DNA
+      - S7 (unsaid + unspeakable sentence) → subtext engine, what every scene carries
+      - S8 (decision + location + sensory trigger) → structural spine, pivot specificity
+      - S9 (last image + contrast with S2) → full story arc, transformation proof
+      - S10 (feel reference + specific scene described) → hyper-specific tone, pacing
+      - S11 (what not to have + feeling to avoid) → anti-pattern map, rejection reasoning
+      - S12 (unexpected element + subtext sentence) → originality layer, hidden current
 
-      Q12. WAQT AUR MAASAM:
-          "Yeh story kab ki hai — raat ya din, kaun sa season, kaunsa waqt?
-          Aur tumhare dimaag mein aisa kyun hai — woh specific time ya maasam
-          is kahani ke liye kyun sahi lagta hai?"
+      RULE: Koi bhi proposed element bina seed se trace kiye nahi rahega.
+            Agar koi element kisi seed se trace nahi hota → woh AI generic default hai → HATA DO.
 
-      Q13. WOH JAGAH JAHAN JAANA NAHI CHAHTE:
-          "Protagonist ki ek aisi jagah hai — physical ya emotional — jahan
-          woh kabhi nahi jaana chahta. Lekin story unhe wahan le jaati hai.
-          Kaunsi jagah hai woh? Wahan jaake unhe kya face karna padta hai?"
+      **STEP 2: GENERATE ARCHITECTURE — then USER KO DIKHAO:**
 
-      Q14. DUNIYA KA RANG:
-          "Is duniya mein sab theek nahi hai. Kuch badal raha hai, kuch toot
-          raha hai, ya kuch build ho raha hai background mein. Kya hai woh?"

-          "Ek choice — sirf ek — jo sab kuch badal deti hai. Protagonist leti
-          hai ya nahi leti, dono mein se ek. Kya hai woh decision? Aur woh

-      Q16. SABSE BURA WALA MOMENT:
-          "Story ka lowest point — jab lagta hai sab khatam ho gaya, koi rasta
-          nahi. Kya hota hai tab? Protagonist kahan hota hai, kya feel kar
-          raha hai, kya sochta hai?"
+      RELATIONSHIP BLUEPRINT:

-          "Is story mein ek aur insaan hai — shayad secondary character —
-          jis pe protagonist decide karta hai ki sach bol sakta hai.
-          Woh kaun hai? Unke beech kya connection hai?"
+      STORY SPINE:

-          "Koi reveal, koi twist, koi aisi baat jo audience ko puri story
-          naye angle se dekhne pe majboor kare? Hai aisi koi cheez tumhare
-          dimaag mein? (Hona zaroori nahi — agar hai toh batao.)"
+      SUBTEXT LAYER:
+      → The unsaid current (never stated, always felt): [S7 unspeakable sentence woven into]
+      → The hidden line audience will understand: [S12 subtext sentence]
 
-      Q19. AAKHRI IMAGE:
-          "Film ka last scene — tumhare dimaag mein koi ek image hai.
-          Kya hai woh? Kaun hai frame mein, kya ho raha hai, kaisi feeling hai?"

-          koi trope, koi moment jo tumhe dekhke irritate karta hai films mein.
-          Woh kya hai?"

-      **MANDATORY RULES FOR ASKING:**
-
-      0. **CONCEPT MINING PEHLE.** Writer ke initial words se threads nikalo. Structured questions
-         baad mein. Yeh rule kabhi skip mat karo.
-      1. **70% WRITER KE WORDS SE.** Writer jo bhi bolte hain — usse pehle exhaust karo questions se.
-         AI ki taraf se koi cheez introduce mat karo jab tak writer ki sab threads explore na ho jaayein.
-      2. **Ek baar mein 2-3 sawal se zyada mat poochho.** Writer ko breathe karne do.
-      3. **Koi option mat do.** "A, B, C mein se choose karo" — yeh NAHI. Khule sawal poochho.
-      4. **Writer ke jawab pe follow-up karo.** Agar koi interesting cheez kahi — ek follow-up
-         question poochho woh aur kholo. Workflow se thoda aage-peeche hona theek hai.
-      5. **Summarize baar baar.** Har phase ke baad: "Theek hai, main samajh raha hoon — [summary]. Sahi hai?"
-      6. **Suggestion mat do.** "Kya aap soch rahe hain ki protagonist ek doctor ho?" — yeh GALAT.
-         Writer ke dimaag se nikalna chahiye, tumhare se nahi.
-      7. **Silence respected karo.** Agar writer "pata nahi" kahe — "theek hai, chhodo — agle sawaal
-         pe chalte hain. Yeh baad mein khud aa sakta hai."

+      (PASS 0 runs FIRST — before all others. Then PASS 1-5 in order.)
+
+      **PASS 0 — SEED TRACEABILITY FINAL CHECK (Run FIRST):**
+      Story ka final version likhne se pehle — har element trace karo:
+      - Character wound/psychology → S5 depth probe? Agar nahi → REWRITE from seed
+      - World detail 1 → S2 depth probe (light/sound)? Agar nahi → REWRITE
+      - World detail 2 → S4/S6/S7? Agar nahi → REWRITE
+      - Relationship dynamic → S6 + S7 unspeakable sentence? Agar nahi → REWRITE
+      - Story pivot specifics → S8 depth probe (location + sensory)? Agar nahi → REWRITE
+      - Subtext current → S12 subtext sentence? Agar nahi → REWRITE
+      - Tone/visual → S10 specific scene described? Agar nahi → REWRITE
+      ZERO TOLERANCE: Koi bhi untraced element = generic AI default = hatao.
+      Yeh AI ka 60% ko writer ke 40% seeds mein grounded rakhta hai.
+
+      **PASS 1 — ANTI-PATTERN FILTER (OUTPUT TO USER — MANDATORY):**
+      Is story ki 3 sabse predictable versions internally identify karo.
+      Phir inhe USER KO DIKHAO — story likhne se PEHLE. Yeh step skip nahi hoga.
+
+      **USER KO DIKHAO (MANDATORY FORMAT):**
+      ```
+      Is story ke teen sabse predictable versions jo main NAHI likh raha:
+
+      ❌ Version 1: [Generic version — 1-2 lines, writer ke genre/concept se directly related]
+      ❌ Version 2: [Generic version — 1-2 lines, alag angle se]
+      ❌ Version 3: [Generic version — 1-2 lines, ek aur common trap]
+
+      Yeh teeno avoid kiye gaye hain. Ab 4th version likh raha hoon.
+      ```
+
+      Phir internally "4th version" determine karo — unexpected but earned from writer's own answers.
+      Check: "Yeh story ka core kisi aur film jaisa toh nahi?" → Yes = rethink approach.
+
+      **PASS 2 — ELEMENT BALANCE CHECK (Relationship as Engine):**
+      Kya PLOT drive kar raha hai ya RELATIONSHIP+EMOTION?
+      → Agar PLOT: Reverse engineer karo — relationship decision se plot emerge karao
+      → Har major plot point trace karo: "Yeh kisi character ki emotional state ya relationship dynamic se kyun ho raha hai?"
+      → Subtext layer: Jo kaha gaya + Jo nahi kaha gaya + Jo chahte hain = teeno alag hone chahiye
+
+      **PASS 3 — SPECIFICITY DRILL (Generic → Cinematic):**
+      Har story element ko hyper-specific banao BEFORE writing:
+      - Generic world → ek specific smell/sound/color only HERE (use Q12a answer)
+      - Generic conflict → exact moment, exact word, exact silence (use Q10c answer)
+      - Generic character → use contradiction (Q10a) + want vs need (Q7) + rishta (Q10b-Q10e)
+      Test: "Kya koi isko kisi aur story mein copy kar sakta hai?" → Yes = aur specific karo
+
+      **PASS 4 — EMOTIONAL SUBVERSION MAP:**
+      Har major scene mein: audience EXPECTS kya feel karna? → Deliver unexpected version (earned):
+      - Expected: Big confrontation → Deliver: Silence, ek sentence, phir walk away
+      - Expected: Victory → Deliver: Victory + loss of what they were really fighting for
+      Goal: Audience ko ek unexpected emotional dhakka — jo SAHI bhi lage, SURPRISING bhi
+
+      **PASS 5 — "ONLY THIS STORY" TEST:**
+      Har plot point: "Kya yeh EXACT moment kisi aur film mein alag characters ke saath ho sakta tha?"
+      Agar YES → Rewrite until it couldn't happen anywhere else.
+      Characters ki specific psychology + world ka specific pressure = unique irreplaceable moment.
+      Use Q10b-Q10e (rishta answers) + Q12a (world anchor) + Q10a (contradiction) to make it specific.

+      - Ek direction is Q23/Q23a (unexpected element / subtext) se driven honi chahiye
+      - "Kaunsa lagta hai tumhara?" = recognition prompt, not a choice question
+      - Agar writer kehta hai "teeno nahi" → probe: "kaunsa element bilkul wrong lag raha hai?" → adjust
