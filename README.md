### **Two-Agent Screenplay Model**
Industry-authentic Bollywood approach:

- **Dialogue Writer (Samvad Lekhak)**: Impactful dialogue craft
- Credits: "Screenplay by X, Dialogues by Y" (like real Bollywood films)

### **Language/Dialect Control**
- **Default**: Simple Bollywood Hindi (60-70% Hindi, 30-40% English)
- **Dialects**: Pure Hindi, Hinglish, Haryanvi, Bihari, Punjabi, Marathi, and more
- Character-specific application based on backgrounds

### **Complete Shot Breakdown**
- Shot-by-shot specifications (camera, framing, lighting, blocking)
- Genre-appropriate cinematography (thriller = close-ups, romance = soft focus)
- Coverage strategy for editing flexibility
- Shooting order optimization
- Equipment requirements and production notes

### **Feedback Loops**
Review and iterate at every step:
```
"The dialogue in Scene 5 is too formal, make it conversational"
"Make Ananya's backstory show more trauma"
"Add 3 more close-ups in the interrogation scene"
```
