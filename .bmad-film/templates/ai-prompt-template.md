# AI Video Generation Prompts: [SCENE NAME]

**Scene**: [X] - [Scene Name]
**Total Shots**: [Number]
**Total Duration**: [Minutes:Seconds]
**AI Tool Target**: [Runway / Pika / Sora / Midjourney / etc.]

---

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Copy the full prompt** for each shot (everything in the code block)
2. **Paste into your AI video generation tool**
3. **Adjust parameters** as needed for your specific tool
4. **Generate video** following tool-specific workflow
5. **Iterate** if needed (adjust prompt based on output)
6. **Export** in highest quality available
7. **Import to editing software** for assembly

### Important Notes:
- Current AI tools work best with 10-15 second clips
- Longer shots may need to be split into multiple segments
- Maintain consistency markers between related shots (same character, location, lighting)
- Some shots may be better filmed traditionally (check notes per shot)
- Use negative prompts to avoid common AI errors
- Provide reference images when possible for consistency

## Example: Complete AI Prompt

### SHOT 1-1: Police Station Establishing Shot

**Duration**: 4 seconds
**Complexity**: Simple
**AI Suitability**: High (static architecture, no people)

### Full AI Prompt

```
Shot Type: Wide establishing shot
Duration: 4 seconds
Aspect Ratio: 16:9

Visual Description:
Indian police station (chowki) exterior building at pre-dawn. Three-story concrete municipal building with "Police Station" signage visible in both Hindi (पुलिस स्टेशन) and English. Architecture: practical, institutional, modern Indian government building (not colonial-era). Building façade: cream/beige concrete, barred windows, main entrance with steps. Few parked police vehicles visible (white with blue stripe). Empty street in foreground with 1-2 passing vehicles (motion blur). Adjacent buildings visible on sides (residential/commercial). Sky: pre-dawn, dark blue fading to lighter blue at horizon. Interior lights glowing warm yellow through some windows.

Camera:
- Angle: Eye-level, slight low angle (looking up at building, emphasizing institutional authority)
- Movement: Static, locked-off, no camera movement
- Framing: Building centered in frame, occupying 60% of frame height, symmetrical composition
- Lens feel: Wide angle (24mm equivalent), slight architectural perspective

Lighting:
- Time: Pre-dawn (5:30 AM), blue hour
- Quality: Soft, diffused natural light (no direct sun)
- Direction: Ambient overhead (even, shadowless)
- Mood: Somber, institutional, cold but not threatening
- Color: Cool blue exterior tones contrasting with warm yellow interior practical lights

Performance:
N/A (no characters in shot)

Style & Mood:
- Genre: Psychological thriller, police procedural
- Cinematography style: Bollywood neo-noir, Sujoy Ghosh atmospheric realism, similar to Kahaani opening
- Mood: Institutional authority, early morning solemnity, anticipation
- Color palette: Cool blues (exterior), warm yellows (interior lights), desaturated overall
- Reference: Realistic Bollywood thriller cinematography, architectural establishing shots from Drishyam, Andhadhun

Technical:
- Quality: Cinematic, professional filmmaking, high production value, sharp details
- Realism: Photorealistic, authentic Indian urban architecture and environment
- Detail: Deep focus, everything in frame sharp from foreground street to building to sky

Negative Prompt:
cartoon, anime, illustration, American police station, NYPD, European architecture, overly bright, sunny daytime, crowded, people visible, distorted perspective, unrealistic colors, overly saturated, generic, stock photo look, colonial-era building, fortress-like, intimidating, dystopian
```

### Consistency Markers (Important for AI)
- **Location**: This exact building appearance must be maintained in any exterior shots
- **Time of Day**: Blue hour (5:30 AM) - same lighting if returning to exterior
- **Color Palette**: Cool blues with warm interior lights
- **Architecture Style**: Modern Indian municipal (not colonial, not fortress)
- **Signage**: "Police Station" in Hindi and English visible

### Alternative Prompt (If First Fails)
```
Establishing shot of a realistic Indian police chowki building at dawn. Modern 3-story concrete building, institutional architecture, pre-dawn blue hour lighting. Building has barred windows with warm light glowing inside. Empty street in front, few vehicles. Cool blue ambient light outside, warm yellow window glow. Cinematic Bollywood thriller style. Camera static, building centered, wide angle. Professional photorealistic quality.
```

### Post-Generation Notes
- **Expected Output Quality**: Sharp architectural details, realistic lighting (cool/warm contrast), clean composition, no distortion
- **Common AI Errors to Watch For**:
  - Distorted architecture (verify straight lines, realistic proportions)
  - Wrong signage (check Hindi text is correct, not gibberish)
  - American/Western police station instead of Indian
  - Wrong time of day (too bright/dark)
  - Unrealistic elements (flying, fantasy architecture)
- **If Output Unsatisfactory**:
  - Simplify prompt to "Indian police station building exterior at dawn"
  - Provide reference image of actual Indian police station
  - Consider shooting this traditionally (simple static shot)
- **Editing Considerations**:
  - This is Scene 1 opening shot
  - Next shot cuts to interior (clock close-up)
  - Hold for full 4 seconds (don't rush)
  - Audio: add ambient city sounds in post

## Batch Generation Strategy

For efficient workflow when generating multiple shots:

### Phase 1: All Static Shots First
- Generate establishing shots, locked-off cameras
- These have highest AI success rate
- Verify quality before moving to complex shots

### Phase 2: Simple Movement Shots
- Slow pans, tilts, basic camera movement
- Character simple actions (walking, sitting)

### Phase 3: Complex Shots
- Multiple characters, dialogue, complex movement
- These may need multiple iterations
- Consider hybrid (AI background + filmed foreground)

### Phase 4: Fallback to Traditional
- If certain shots repeatedly fail with AI
- Identify which shots need human filming
- Integrate AI and traditional footage in edit

## Tool-Specific Notes

### For Runway Gen-3:
- Use "Motion Brush" for controlled movement
- Break long shots into 10-second segments
- Use "Camera Motion" controls for camera movement

### For Pika:
- Leverage "Modify Region" for consistency
- Use "Expand Canvas" for reframing
- "Lip Sync" feature for dialogue shots

### For Sora (when available):
- Longer durations possible (up to 60 seconds)
- More complex camera movements supported
- Better character consistency

### For Midjourney + Runway Pipeline:
- Generate establishing frame in Midjourney
- Use as first frame in Runway for video
- Ensures specific visual aesthetic
