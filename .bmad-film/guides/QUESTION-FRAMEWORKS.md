## 🎯 Question Delivery Best Practices

### **DO**:
✓ Ask conversationally, not like a form
✓ Give examples for clarity
✓ Allow "not sure, you decide" answers
✓ Ask follow-ups based on previous answers
✓ Bundle related questions
✓ Be excited about possibilities

### **DON'T**:
✗ Ask all questions at once (overwhelming)
✗ Make every question mandatory
✗ Use technical jargon without explaining
✗ Judge user's answers
✗ Rush through questions
✗ Ignore user's "I don't know" responses

---

## 🚀 Implementation Notes

Each agent should:

1. **Load appropriate question set** based on step
2. **Ask questions in batches** (5-7 at a time)
3. **Process answers** and make creative decisions
4. **Ask follow-ups** based on answers
5. **Summarize understanding** before creating
6. **Create output** matching user's vision

---

**These questions transform users from prompt-givers to co-writers.**

**Ready to integrate into agents!** 🎬
