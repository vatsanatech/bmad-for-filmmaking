## 📋 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### **STEP 1: Story Synopsis** ✅

**What It Creates**:
- `genre-analysis.md` - Genre identification and specialist agent selection
- `story-synopsis.md` - Complete story with multi-layered twists

**Agents Used**:
- Master Story Director (routes to specialist)
- Genre Specialist Agent (8 options):
  - Thriller Specialist (Anurag Kashyap/Sriram Raghavan style)
  - Romance Specialist (Karan Johar/Imtiaz Ali style)
  - Horror Specialist (Ram Gopal Varma/Vikram Bhatt style)
  - Comedy Specialist (Rajkumar Hirani/Hrishikesh Mukherjee style)
  - Action Specialist (Rohit Shetty/Siddharth Anand style)
  - Drama Specialist (Zoya Akhtar/Shoojit Sircar style)

  - Social Specialist (Shyam Benegal/Neeraj Ghaywan style)

**Training**: Each agent trained on Bollywood master filmmakers' styles

**Output Quality**:

### **STEP 2: Character Bible** ✅

**What It Creates**:
- `character-bible.md` - Comprehensive character profiles

**Agent Used**:
- Character Developer

**What's Included**:
- **Principal Characters**: Full depth
  - Physical description (for casting/AI)

  - Backstory (relevant history)
  - Character arc (transformation)
  - Speaking voice (Hindi-English ratio, speech patterns)
  - Behavioral traits (mannerisms, reactions)
  - Relationships (with other characters)

- **Supporting Characters**: Moderate detail
- **Minor Characters**: Brief profiles

**Why This Step**:

**How to Execute**: Just tell project name
```

### **STEP 3: Screenplay Structure** ✅ (NEW - BOLLYWOOD AUTHENTIC)

**What It Creates**:

**Agent Used**:
- Screenplay Structure Writer (Genre-Trained)

**Focus**:

- ✅ Scene establishment (atmosphere, mood, visual tone)
- ✅ Action lines (visual storytelling, what we SEE and HEAR)
- ✅ Character introductions (memorable first appearances)
- ✅ Character behavior and movement
- ✅ **Placeholder dialogue** (functional, shows information and tone)

**Genre Training** (Applies Appropriate Style):
- **Thriller**: Tension in descriptions, observational details, suspense pacing
- **Romance**: Emotional atmosphere, character connection shown physically
- **Horror**: Dread and unease, sensory details, what's NOT seen matters
- **Comedy**: Setup/payoff structure, physical comedy opportunities
- **Action**: Dynamic movement, clear geography, impact emphasis

**What It Does NOT Include**:
- ❌ Camera directions (cinematographer's job)
- ❌ Technical notes (lighting, sound, editing)

- ✅ Genre-appropriate dialogue style
- ✅ Language/dialect authenticity
- ✅ Memorable, quotable lines (Bollywood specialty)
- ✅ Subtext and layered meaning
- ✅ Natural, actable speech

**Genre Training** (Applies Appropriate Dialogue Style):

- **Horror**: Believable fear, fragmented under terror, denial/rationalization
- **Comedy**: Wit and wordplay, timing, rapid-fire in arguments
- **Action**: Short punchy lines, one-liners, urgent declarations

**Language/Dialect Options**:

**Default**: Simple Bollywood Hindi
- 60-70% Hindi, 30-40% English
- Natural code-switching
- Accessible to pan-India audience

**Available Dialects**:
- **Pure Hindi** (90% Hindi, formal/literary)

- **Bihari/Bhojpuri** (earthy, colorful)
- **Marathi-influenced** (Mumbai local flavor)

**Output**: Final production-ready screenplay with Bollywood-quality dialogue

## 🎭 Why Two Agents for Screenplay? (Bollywood Authentic)

### **Industry Practice**:

**Bollywood Tradition**:
```
Film Credits Show:
- "Screenplay: [Name 1]"
- "Dialogues: [Name 2]"

Often SEPARATE people, sometimes same person with separate credits
```

**Examples**:
- **3 Idiots**: Screenplay (Hirani, Joshi) + Dialogues (Hirani, Joshi) - Same people, separate credits
- **Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara**: Screenplay (Zoya, Reema) + Dialogues (Farhan Akhtar) - DIFFERENT specialists

### **Why Dialogue Is Separate in Hindi Cinema**:
- Dialogue is EXTREMELY important in Bollywood (people remember lines)
- "Mogambo khush hua", "Mere paas maa hai", "Picture abhi baaki hai"
- Dialogue delivery is key to star performances
- Regional flavor, cultural authenticity needs specialist
- "Dialogue baazi" (dialogue duel) is genre strength

### **Benefits of Two-Agent Model**:
1. **Better Specialization**: Dialogue is an art form in Hindi cinema
2. **Genre Expertise**: Both agents trained for genre-appropriate styles
3. **Quality**: Dialogue gets dedicated attention (not rushed with structure)
4. **Character Voices**: Dialogue writer focuses purely on distinct voices
5. **Authenticity**: Matches Bollywood production practice
6. **Iteration**: Can revise dialogue without touching screenplay structure

## 🎯 How to Execute (Complete Workflow)

### **For a New Project**:

**Step 1: Create Story**

```

**Step 2: Create Character Bible**
```
You: "band-darwaza"  (just project name)
→ System creates character-bible.md
```

**Step 3: Create Screenplay** (Two-Agent Process - Automatic)
```
You: "band-darwaza"  (just project name)
OR
You: "band-darwaza in Haryanvi dialect"  (with language specification)

→ System executes:
   1. Screenplay Structure Writer creates structure with placeholder dialogue
   2. Dialogue Writer replaces placeholders with final impactful dialogue
   3. Outputs: screenplay-structure.md (reference) + screenplay.md (final)
```

**Language Options**:
- Default (if not specified): Simple Bollywood Hindi
