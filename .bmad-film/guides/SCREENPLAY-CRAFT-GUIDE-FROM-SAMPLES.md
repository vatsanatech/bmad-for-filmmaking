## SECTION 1: FORMATTING VARIANTS — 3 REAL INDUSTRY PATTERNS

Indian screenplays use THREE distinct formatting traditions. Know which to apply.

---

### FORMAT TYPE A — HIRANI/BOLLYWOOD MAINSTREAM (Munnabhai MBBS Style)

**Used by**: Rajkumar Hirani, Vidhu Vinod Chopra productions
**Best for**: Commercial Bollywood, comedy, mainstream cinema

```
SCENE 1A                                    EXT / CARTER ROAD / DAY.

(Action lines in parentheses — italic/colored in production drafts)

CHARACTER NAME
Dialogue line here.

(Short action beat in parentheses — can be standalone)

CHARACTER NAME
(parenthetical note)
More dialogue.
```

**Key Rules for Hirani Format:**
- Scene heading: `SCENE [NUMBER][LETTER]` LEFT — `EXT / LOCATION / TIME.` RIGHT
- Scene heading: **BOLD, highlighted (yellow in PDF)**, full-width
- Action lines: In parentheses `(action description)` — colored RED in production drafts
- Character name: LEFT-aligned, NO INDENT, ALL CAPS
- Dialogue: Full-width, left-aligned (NOT centered)
- No scene numbers in right margin
- Header: Film title (left) + Production company (right) on every page
- "CONFIDENTIAL" watermark on all pages
- Page number: Bottom center

**Location format examples (Hirani):**
```
SCENE 1A                        EXT / CARTER ROAD / DAY.
SCENE 1B                        BANDRA BYLANES EXT / DAY.
SCENE 2A                        EXT / MUNNA'S HOUSE/BASTI/DAY
SCENE 4                         EXT/INT / MUNNA HOUSE / DAY
```

---

### FORMAT TYPE B — STANDARD AMERICAN (Dangal / Article 15 / Thappad Style)

**Used by**: Nitesh Tiwari, Anubhav Sinha, most mainstream Hindi film writers
**Best for**: Feature films, prestige productions, OTT features

```
INT. LOCATION - TIME

Action lines. Full-width, left-aligned, present tense.
Short paragraphs. Show don't tell.

                    CHARACTER NAME
            (parenthetical if needed)
        Dialogue here, indented/centered block.

                    CHARACTER NAME (CONT'D)
        Continued dialogue if runs to next page.

                    CHARACTER NAME (V.O.)
        Voice-over dialogue.

CUT TO:                                                       (right-aligned)
```

**Key Rules for Standard Format:**
- Scene heading: `INT./EXT. LOCATION - TIME` — ALL CAPS, left-aligned, numbered
- Character name: CENTERED, ALL CAPS, above dialogue
- Dialogue: Centered/indented block (not full-width)
- Parentheticals: Centered below character name, lowercase in brackets
- V.O. = Voice Over: `CHARACTER NAME (V.O.)`

- CONT'D = Continued dialogue: `CHARACTER NAME (CONT'D)`
- Transitions: `CUT TO:` right-aligned | `FADE IN:` left-aligned
- Page number: Top-right corner
- Scene numbers: Left margin, optional right margin

**Thappad variation — scene numbers both sides:**
```
1    EXT. DELHI STREETS - NIGHT                              1
1A   EXT. DELHI STREET - NIGHT                              1A
2    INT. DELHI STREET - NIGHT                              2
```

**Article 15 variation — slash for parallel locations:**
```
4    INT. CAR|RURAL HIGHWAY|DELHI - DAY
```

**`(MORE)` for dialogue overflow to next page:**
```
                    NETRA
        Koi chori nahin hai. Tumhein bhi
        khush rehne ka haq hai. Mujhe bhi.
                        (MORE)
```

---

## SECTION 3: OPENING SCENE MASTERCLASS — 8 REAL EXAMPLES

### The HIRANI HOOK (Munnabhai MBBS)
**Strategy**: IN-THE-MIDDLE-OF-ACTION + CHARACTER INTRODUCED DOING SOMETHING
```
Opening: Chase sequence. Munna as fake taxi driver. Gun chase.
We meet Munna through his BEHAVIOR — not a description.
He's funny, street-smart, survival instinct — ALL VISIBLE in action.
```
**Lesson**: Character personality = FIRST ACTION they take. If first act is running from danger while cracking jokes = that IS the character.

**Template for commercial Bollywood opening:**
1. Scene 1: Action/situation already in progress (no setup)
2. Hero appears IN the situation (not entering it)
3. Hero's personality visible through first words/actions
4. Comedy/energy establishes tone in 2 minutes

---

### The DANGAL HOOK (Nitesh Tiwari)
**Strategy**: WOUND VISIBLE IN FIRST SCENE + PARALLEL IMAGERY
```
Opening: Mahavir Singh watching wrestling on TV at work.
Colleagues disapprove. But he can't stop watching.
His OBSESSION = his WOUND = his DREAM — all in first 2 pages.
Then: office wrestling fight (mirrors TV wrestling = brilliant parallel)
Then: Cousin V.O. establishes backstory over MONTAGE
```
**Lesson**: Protagonist's core wound/obsession must be visible within first 3 pages. The story is about that wound — never hide it.

**Template for biopic/sports film opening:**
1. Show protagonist's passion/obsession first (before anything else)
2. Show society's disapproval (creates conflict immediately)
3. Brief backstory through V.O. over visual montage
4. Establish the "price he's already paid" for this obsession

---

### The ARTICLE 15 HOOK (Anubhav Sinha)
**Strategy**: SHOW THE PROBLEM BEFORE THE HERO
```
Pre-title: 14-year old girl being assaulted in a moving bus.
No hero. Just the horror. FADE TO BLACK.
Second scene: Revolutionary folk song. Hope against horror.
THEN: Title appears. THEN: Hero introduced driving into this world.
```
**Lesson**: For social cinema — DON'T introduce hero first. Show what's WRONG with the world. Audience must feel the problem before meeting the person who'll confront it.

**Template for social issue film:**
1. Pre-title: Show the injustice/horror (no hero present)
2. Brief hope/resistance (counter-point)
3. TITLE
4. Hero arrives INTO this world as outsider
5. Hero's first contact with the problem = immediate

---

### The ALIGARH HOOK (Hansal Mehta / Apurva Asrani)
**Strategy**: NORMALCY FIRST, THEN INVASION
```
Opening: Professor Siras — evening walk, buying vegetables,
picking up food from dhaba, riding rickshaw home, humming a song.
Every action = his dignity, his ordinary humanity.
THEN: Sting operation. Intruders break in. FADE TO BLACK.
```
**Lesson**: The audience must LOVE the protagonist before tragedy strikes. Spend time showing normal, dignified life FIRST. The more ordinary, the more devastating the violation.

**Template for dignified character tragedy:**
1. Show protagonist's ordinary evening/day in detail
2. Each mundane detail = character revelation
3. One peaceful moment at home
4. Then: intrusion/violation/destruction
5. Cut to: how the world responds

---

### The SHERNI HOOK (Amit Masurkar)
**Strategy**: COMIC MISDIRECT + IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
```
Opening: Man crawling like a tiger for a camera trap. Funny.
Hero arrives simply: "Chalo." No fanfare.
Immediate issue: watering hole dried. Bureaucracy doing nothing.
First dialogue = bureaucracy evading responsibility.
```
**Lesson**: Comic opening that immediately pivots to the core conflict. Hero doesn't arrive heroically — she arrives and walks straight into the problem. No "introducing the hero" ceremony.

**Template for quiet heroism / naturalistic drama:**
1. Funny/absurd image to open (establishes tone — not a tragedy)
2. Hero appears without fanfare, just doing the job
3. Immediate problem visible (bureaucracy/corruption/nature)
4. Hero's competence shown through a small specific action
5. First antagonist encounter in scene 2-3 (not much later)

---

### The THAPPAD HOOK (Anubhav Sinha)
**Strategy**: MULTIPLE LIVES → ONE WORLD
```
Pre-title: 4-5 vignettes of different couples/women.
Scene 1: Young couple on bike debating marriage (playful).
Scene 2: A woman playing with wind from car window.
Scene 3: Old couple — sweet nostalgia.
Scene 4: Middle-aged woman trying to find love again.
Scene 5: Haryanvi couple on bicycle — marital complaints.
Then the final credit. THEN: We meet our protagonist Amrita.
```
**Lesson**: Before showing ONE story, show that this story belongs to MANY lives. It's not about one woman — it's about all women. Opening multiplicity creates thematic resonance.

**Template for thematic/ensemble story:**
1. 4-5 rapid vignettes of different lives sharing the same theme
2. Each vignette = 20-30 seconds maximum
3. Some are funny, some poignant — tone variety keeps audience
4. After credits: HERO introduced in their own scene
5. Hero's first scene shows their version of the theme

---

### The AARYA HOOK (Ram Madhvani)
**Strategy**: MAXIMUM NORMALCY + HIDDEN BOMB
```
Opening: Aarya upside down in yoga rings. Phone buzzing. Kids fighting.
We see: perfect family, morning chaos, love, routine.
Scene 1.3: 8-year-old Adi finds a GUN in father's car.
Adi takes it in his bag. Goes to school.
```
**The Bomb Under the Table**: We see normal family breakfast. But WE KNOW the gun is now in a child's bag. Every smile is now ominous.

**Lesson**: The Hitchcock bomb. In episode 1 scene 3, hide the explosive element while life appears normal. Audience carries the secret tension even when characters don't.

**Template for domestic thriller / crime drama:**
1. Scene 1: Perfect/happy domestic world. Establish what will be lost.
2. Scene 2: Small hint of the hidden world (a phone call, a glance)
3. Scene 3: The SECRET is planted (gun in glove compartment, code on phone)
4. Rest of episode: Audience knows. Characters don't. TENSION.

---

### The PAATAL LOK HOOK (Sudip Sharma)
**Strategy**: CONCEPT STATED FIRST, THEN DEMONSTRATED
```
ON BLACK: "Teen duniya hai... swarg lok, dharti lok, paatal lok."
THEN: Inspector Hathi Ram driving through Delhi slums.
His dialogue with Ansari IS the concept (swarg lok = rich, paatal lok = poor).
His shoe steps in shit → perfect metaphor for his life.
Cut to: Hotel corridor → flashy assassins → action begins.
```
**Lesson**: State your film's philosophy/theme in V.O. before showing anything. Then IMMEDIATELY demonstrate that philosophy in the first scene. The character EMBODIES the theme — he doesn't explain it.

**Template for concept-driven crime/thriller:**
1. ON BLACK: V.O. stating the central metaphor/philosophy (30 seconds)
2. FADE IN: Protagonist's world — the metaphor made visible
3. First dialogue = character's cynical worldview (earned from experience)
4. A small physical comedy/irony (shoe in shit = he's in the shit too)
5. Jump cut to: The event that will disrupt everything

---

## SECTION 4: CHARACTER INTRODUCTION MASTERCLASS

Every real screenplay introduces important characters with exactly 3 elements:
1. **NAME** (ALL CAPS on first appearance)
2. **Age** (in parentheses)
3. **Defining detail** (physical + personality in one compressed image)

### Real Examples Analyzed:

**HATHI RAM (Paatal Lok):**
```
INSPECTOR HATHI RAM CHAUDHARI drives it – mid 40s, with
tired, cynical eyes that say he never got his due.
```
→ Name. Age. One image = entire character psychology. "Never got his due" = his wound.

**AARYA (Aarya Ep 1):**
```
We introduce a 40-year old, tall, fit and athletic woman,
in her yoga pants upside down hanging on her training rings.
```
→ Age. Physical. She's literally upside down in her world.

**MAHAVIR SINGH (Dangal):**
```
a young man around 25-28 years old, looking at the TV from
the window. A smile appears on his face.
```
→ Age range. Exact action. Emotion = obsession/love.

**DEEPU (Aligarh):**
```
DEEPU Mathew, 23, is sitting inside the Indian Express office
in his socks, feet up on the desk.
```
→ Name. Age. "Feet up, socks" = irreverent, unconventional. No need to say "he's a rebel."

**VIDYA (Sherni):**
```
VIDYA in camouflage walks towards them at a distance.
```
→ Minimal. Action-first. She appears in her element. Everything said by what she's wearing and where she is.

**CHAAKU (Paatal Lok):**
```
The flashy CHAAKU, 25, stands there — cheap sunglasses,
a cigarette dangling from his lips. A bad boy cliché.
```
→ The writer KNOWS it's a cliché and acknowledges it. This is self-aware writing.

**THE RULE:**
```
[NAME], [AGE], [COMPRESSED IMAGE THAT = CHARACTER]
```
Never: "NAME is a kind, intelligent person who..." — SHOW through the compressed image.

---

## SECTION 5: ACTION LINE MASTERY — TECHNIQUES FROM REAL SCRIPTS

### Technique 1: The Staccato Montage (Dangal - Nitesh Tiwari)
For showing passing time / world-building rapidly:
```
Mugdars arranged in an akhada.
Desi push ups.
Desi sit ups.
Wrestlers getting massage done.
Wrestlers touching guru's feet.
Mud in akhada.
Wrestlers drinking milk.
```
→ Each line = one shot. One-liner = one image. Maximum efficiency.

### Technique 2: The Sensory Reveal (Paatal Lok - Sudip Sharma)
Build scene through sensation:
```
CLOSE ON a cockroach. The antennae gently swing about.
Only for a short bit though as –
CRUNCH! A foot comes to land on it.
```
→ Start MICRO (cockroach antenna) → SUDDEN MACRO (crunch). Contrast = impact.

### Technique 3: The Parallel Cut in Writing (Dangal)
Both scenes written as one:
```
Mahavir Singh and Harkindar lock hands. (match to:)
Two wrestlers on TV coming face to face.
COMMENTATOR 1 (V.O.)
    Now the moment we were all waiting for...
```
→ Parallel editing written into action lines. Director doesn't have to guess.

### Technique 4: The Observation Beat (Aarya - Ram Madhvani)
Show character NOTICING things:
```
Tej absent-mindedly picks up a laddoo to eat as he settles
on the dining table. Aarya takes it away and hands him
some yucky looking juice.
AARYA: Triglycerides 330...
Poonam and the cook laugh.
```
→ Observers' reactions validate the moment. Never write "this is funny" — write the cook laughing.

### Technique 5: The Deliberate Underline (Paatal Lok)
Underline key objects/events for emphasis:
```
Chaaku walks up to the table on which lies – a bright
yellow phone. Chaaku picks it up and looks towards –
THE CHAIR. On which sits – TYAGI, 30 – eyes shut,
massaging his head with a chilled water bottle.
```
→ THE CHAIR (underlined). THE SUV (underlined). Physical objects that carry plot weight.

### Technique 6: The Beat (Aligarh / Aarya / Paatal Lok)
"A beat." = pause, silence, reaction, processing:
```
RAJESHWARI
    (without looking up)
    Accha hai...

SOUNDARYA
    Ma! You are not even looking at me.

RAJESHWARI
    (looks up)
    Dekhungi na...

A beat.

SOUNDARYA
    Matlab?
```
→ "A beat" is used by every serious Indian screenwriter. It's a beat of silence where something lands.

### Technique 7: The Revealing Behavior (all scripts)
Never write psychology. Write behavior that SHOWS psychology:
```
GALAT ✗: Aarya feels worried about her family's secrets.
SAHI  ✓: She opens Adi's school bag. Then closes it. Opens it again. Closes it.
```

### CAPITALIZATION RULES IN ACTION LINES:
- SOUND EFFECTS in capitals: CRUNCH, THUD, SCREAM, WIRELESS
- KEY OBJECTS on first important appearance: THE GUN, THE CHAIR, THE KNIFE
- Special moments: FILM TITLES APPEAR, OPENING CREDITS
- Technical instructions: WIDE SHOT, CLOSE ON, ANGLE ON, CUT BACK OUTSIDE

---

## SECTION 6: DIALOGUE CRAFT — WHAT MAKES IT REAL

### The Bambaiya Vocabulary (Hirani - Munnabhai)
- "apun" (I/me, Mumbai street), "mamu" (uncle = naive person), "yaar" (friend)
- Short exclamations: "Aaeeyyy...", "Kya?", "Abe!"
- Prayer as comedy: "Jai Bajrang bali, bacha le prabhu... aey, Hanuman Chalisa bol, jaldi."
- Social commentary as character voice:
  ```
  CIRCUIT: Kyon, apna circuit fuse nahin karne ka, kya? 6 foot ka ek aadmi
  na do do foot ke teen bana dalega.
  ```

### The Haryanvi Texture (Dangal - Nitesh Tiwari)
- Regional dialect markers: "baisaab" (sir), "hoya" (hua), "khadiya" (piyega)
- Dialogue encodes worldview: "Chhoddi nahi bai, chhhodni padgi. Pehalwanni main sohrat kamaai, ijjat kamaai, bas paise nai kama paaya. Naukri kar lee."
- CONTAINS THE ENTIRE STORY: dignity over money. That's Mahavir's dilemma in one line.

### The IPS Officer Voice (Article 15 - Anubhav Sinha)
- Urban-educated Hindi with English code-switching:
  ```
  AYAN: Punishment mila hai sir.
  SP SUBODH LAL: Kyun? Kisi se jhagda ho gaya tha?
  AYAN: Nahi sir, pyaar mohabbat mein hi ho gaya. Shastri sir ko COOL SIR bol diya tha.
  ```
- Character through casual joke. IPS officer who called Secretary "Cool Sir" = his personality in one line.

### The Exhausted Wisdom Voice (Paatal Lok - Sudip Sharma)
- Hathi Ram's dialogue = tiredness with flashes of insight:
  ```
  HATHI RAM: Beta swarg lok mein jo case hota hai na, wo wahin dabaa diya
  jaata hai... toh police wala kya investigate karega aur kya number kamaayega?
  ```
- Philosophy through jaded experience. He doesn't lecture. He explains the SYSTEM through what he's SEEN.

### The Forest Officer Voice (Sherni - Masurkar)
- Minimal, precise, never emotional:
  ```
  VIDYA: Watering holes mein pani bharna aap ka kaam hai?
  MANISH: Ji madam.
  VIDYA: Aur payments toh time pe mil jati hai na?
  MANISH: Ji madam.
  VIDYA: Toh kaam kyu nahi ho raha?
  ```
- She doesn't get angry. She just asks the next logical question. Competence as character.

### DIALOGUE RULES FROM ALL 8 SCRIPTS:

**Rule 1: Every line must do two things**
Either: Plot + Character / Character + Theme / Plot + Theme
Never: Plot only. Dialogue without character reveals is dead.

**Rule 2: The Shorter the Better**
```
MAHAVIR SINGH: Aa gya.
```
Not: "Finally, the match has started!"

**Rule 3: Subtext Over Text**
```
RAJESHWARI (without looking up): Accha hai...
```
Translation: "I'm not interested in this wedding but won't say so directly."

**Rule 4: Dialect Must Be Earned**
Don't add Haryanvi/Bambaiya/regional words randomly.
When you use dialect, be consistent throughout the character's dialogue.
Wrong: Character speaks Mumbai Hindi in scene 1, pure standard Hindi in scene 3.

**Rule 5: Parenthetical Discipline**
Only use parentheticals when:
1. Tone would be misread without it: `(jokingly)`, `(to herself)`
2. Action happens mid-dialogue: `(picks up the gun)`
3. Addressing someone specific: `(to Aarya)`
NEVER: `(with emotions)`, `(tearfully)` — write the action instead.

```
**Scene Numbering:** `[Episode].[Scene]` — `1.1`, `1.2`, `9.4 & 9.5`
**Both margins:** Scene number appears LEFT and RIGHT of heading
**Dots not dashes:** `INT. AARYA'S HOUSE. DAY.` (not `INT. AARYA'S HOUSE - DAY`)
**Scenes per Episode:** 40-80 scenes per episode (shorter scenes)
**Pages per Episode:** 50-65 pages
**OMITTED scenes:** `**OMITTED**` below scene heading
**Revision marks:** `*` in right margin
**Copyright:** Every page bottom: `Regd. with SWA Reg:XXXXXXX © Company`
**Opening:** `FADE IN:` with Title Sequence as scene `0A/0AA`
**Closing:** Each episode ends on cliffhanger or emotional revelation
**Cross-references:** `(we saw him too in Episode 3)` in action lines

**Episode-end patterns from Aarya:**
- Ep 1 end: Child hides gun. Husband has a secret. Normal life = lie.
- Ep 9 end: Aarya arrested. Family collapses. Season cliffhanger.

**Episode-end patterns from Paatal Lok:**
- Ep 1 end: Hathi Ram has the suspects but not the conspiracy
- Ep 9 end: Reveal of Tyagi's mythological destiny. Full circle.

**PAATAL LOK EPISODE TITLES (all thematic/metaphorical):**
```
Ep 2: "LOST AND FOUND"
Ep 3: "A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE"
Ep 4: "SLEEPLESS IN SEELAMPUR"
Ep 5: "TRUTHS & DARES"
Ep 6: "OF FATHERS AND SONS"
Ep 7: "BADLANDS"
Ep 8: "BLACK WIDOW"
Ep 9: (final)
```
→ Episode titles are ALWAYS either: film/cultural reference, character arc in 3 words, or the episode's core metaphor.

**EPISODE TITLE CARD PATTERN (confirmed across ALL 9 Paatal Lok episodes):**
```
[Cold open — no episode title visible]
[Dramatic moment — climax of cold open]
FADE TO BLACK:  (or SLAM FADE TO BLACK for violent episodes)
TITLE APPEARS - 'EPISODE TITLE IN QUOTES'
OPENING CREDITS ROLL.
FADE IN:
[Main story begins — Scene N.2 onward]
```
→ The cold open is ALWAYS scenes [N].1 or [N].1A/1B etc. The title NEVER appears before the cold open.

**MULTI-WRITER PRODUCTION (Paatal Lok confirmed):**
Each episode written by a different writer — but SAME house format throughout:
- Ep2, 5: Sagar Haveli | Ep3: Gunjit Chopra | Ep4: Hardik Mehta
- Ep6: Hardik Mehta & Gunjit Chopra (co-written) | Ep7, 8: Sudip Sharma
→ Format consistency = production house responsibility, not individual writer choice.
→ When generating web series episodes, maintain IDENTICAL format across all episodes regardless of "writer voice."

---

### MICRO DRAMA FORMAT (5-7 min episodes)
**Structure within ONE episode file:**
```
# EPISODE [N]: [EPISODE TITLE]
# [SHOW NAME]
# Episode N of [Total] | Duration: 5-7 minutes

---

## SCENE 1: [SCENE TITLE]
**[N].INT.[LOCATION] - [TIME]**

[Action lines]

CHARACTER
(parenthetical)
Dialogue

---

## SCENE 2: [SCENE TITLE]
...

---

## BEAT SHEET: Episode N
[Beat map]

---

## SCREENPLAY NOTE:
[Production notes]
```

**Key Micro Drama Differences:**
- ALL content in ONE file per episode (Story + Beats + Screenplay + Shots)
- 3-6 scenes per episode maximum
- NO TIME for slow character introduction — character IS the conflict
- Opening hook must land in 30 seconds
- Each scene = one emotional beat
- Cliffhanger or revelation at end of EVERY episode
- Vertical viewing format: interior, intimate, close-ups primary

Seedha camera se: ek purani kothi ka darwaza. Barish ki awaz.
Andar se maddham roshni aati hai.

RIYA (32) darwaze par haath rakhke khadi hai — bheegi hui,
aankhen suji hui, haath kaanpte hain.

Woh andar jaane ki koshish karti hai. Rukti hai.

                    RIYA
            (dheere, apne aap se)
        Kya ye ghar ab bhi mera hai?

Ek baar aur haath darwaze pe rakhti hai.

CUT TO:
```

### Dialogue Block (Vaada):
```
                    CHARACTER NAME
            (parenthetical — lowercase)

## SECTION 9: STRUCTURAL PATTERNS — EPISODE ARC vs FILM ARC

### Film Arc (from real samples):

**Munnabhai MBBS Structure:**
- ACT 1 (25%): Establish Munna's world + catalyst (Babujee arriving)
- ACT 2A (25%): Medical college chaos + Saumy love subplot
- INTERVAL (Bollywood specific): Major reversal — Munna's truth revealed
- ACT 2B (25%): Lowest point + Circuit/friends crisis
- ACT 3 (25%): Final exam + emotional climax + resolution

**Dangal Structure:**
- ACT 1: Mahavir's wrestling obsession + daughter who can fight
- INTERVAL: Geeta wins national + goes to coaching academy
- ACT 2B: Geeta vs Mahavir conflict + losing streak
- ACT 3: Commonwealth Games final + Mahavir trapped + Geeta wins alone

**Article 15 Structure:**
- Pre-title: Horror. Girls hanging.
- ACT 1: Ayan arrives, discovers corruption
- INTERVAL: Discovers girls are alive
- ACT 2B: Threatens power, faces resistance
- ACT 3: Confronts system, partial justice

### Web Series Episode Arc (Aarya / Paatal Lok):

**Episode Structure (45-50 min):**
- TEASER (0-3 min): Hook. No explanation. Just action/mystery.
- ACT 1 (3-15 min): Establish episode's central question
- ACT BREAK 1 (15 min): Complication — new information changes everything
- ACT 2 (15-35 min): Protagonist navigates the complication
- ACT BREAK 2 (35 min): Reversal or revelation
- ACT 3 (35-50 min): Episode resolution + series-level cliffhanger

**The Aarya Promise:**
Each episode promises: "This episode answers: [question], but creates: [new bigger question]"

**The Paatal Lok Promise:**
Each episode: Hathi Ram uncovers one more layer of the conspiracy. But each layer reveals the world is darker than he thought.

```
`*` = Changed or added in this draft revision

**Draft identification on each page:**
```
Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)    2.
```
Left = Draft color and date | Right = Page number

---

## SECTION 12: WHAT MAKES INDIAN STREAMING SCREENPLAYS GREAT

### The Paatal Lok Genius (Sudip Sharma):
1. **Philosophy embedded in voice** — Hathi Ram's V.O. is a world-view, not exposition
2. **Three-world metaphor** — swarg lok (upper class), dharti lok (middle), paatal lok (criminal) — operates on EVERY SCENE
3. **Multiple villain backstories** — Episode 9 flashback: Tyagi's birth horoscope. We understand how evil is MADE.
4. **Visual humor in tragedy** — Hathi Ram steps in shit while philosophizing. Perfect.
5. **Parallel storylines with different tones** — One storyline is dark, another has darkly comic relief.

### The Aarya Genius (Ram Madhvani):
1. **Domestic crime** — The first episode is entirely domestic. The danger is INSIDE the home.
2. **The bomb under the table** — Planted in scene 3. Works for 9 episodes.
3. **Character consistency** — Aarya in episode 1 (upside down, in control) mirrors Aarya in episode 9 (facing the abyss, still standing)
4. **Parallel dialogue** — Two characters speaking simultaneously shows chaos without chaos.
5. **The family system as plot engine** — Every twist comes from family loyalty, family betrayal, family love.

### The Munnabhai Genius (Hirani):
1. **Comedy AS character** — Circuit's long explanations aren't funny lines. They're Circuit's personality. Same lines from anyone else = not funny.
2. **Dual story engine** — Criminal plot (Munnabhai's world) + Medical romance (new world) running in parallel
3. **Earned transformation** — Munna's heart is already good in scene 1 (lets Seth go free). The comedy doesn't mask the emotion — it CARRIES it.

### The Article 15 Genius (Anubhav Sinha):
1. **Outsider as mirror** — Ayan's privileged naivety shows us how terrible things actually are. He's the audience's guide.
2. **Comedy in tragedy** — "Shastri ji ko COOL SIR bol diya" — we laugh AND understand who Ayan is.
3. **Dialogue as social commentary** — "Chhoti jaat hai Sir, Schedule Caste. Sooar palte hain. Hum log paani bhi nahin peete yahan." — Chandra Bhan explains caste discrimination in one factual sentence.

---

## SECTION 13: BMAD-FILM ENFORCEMENT RULES — WHAT THIS GUIDE CHANGES

### For ALL Screenplay Generation:

**RULE 1: CHARACTER INTRODUCTION FORMAT**
```
[NAME IN CAPS] ([AGE]), [ONE COMPRESSED IMAGE = CHARACTER SOUL]
```
Never list personality traits. Show through specific physical position/action.

**RULE 2: OPENING SCENE MUST USE ONE OF 8 TEMPLATES**
Choose the opening strategy that fits the genre:
- Commercial comedy → Hirani (In-The-Middle-Of-Action)
- Sports/biopic → Dangal (Wound-In-First-Action)
- Social issue → Article 15 (Problem-Before-Hero)
- Character tragedy → Aligarh (Normalcy-Before-Invasion)
- Quiet heroism → Sherni (Comic-Misdirect + Immediate-Problem)
- Ensemble theme → Thappad (Multiple-Vignettes)
- Domestic thriller → Aarya (Maximum-Normalcy + Hidden-Bomb)
- Crime/philosophy → Paatal Lok (Concept-First + Demonstration)

**RULE 3: ACTION LINES — BEHAVIOR NOT PSYCHOLOGY**
```
GALAT ✗: "Vidya feels frustrated by the systemic corruption around her."
SAHI  ✓: "Vidya hands him the show cause notice. Doesn't look up."
```

**RULE 4: DIALOGUE — TWO JOBS MINIMUM**
Every dialogue line must do: Plot + Character OR Character + Theme OR Plot + Theme.
Dialogue that only moves plot = cut or rewrite.

**RULE 5: FORMAT SELECTION BY PROJECT TYPE**
- Movie → Standard American (Format Type B) unless commercial = Hirani (Type A)
- Web Series (OTT) → Streaming Professional (Format Type C)
- Micro Drama → BMAD-FILM Vaada Format with combined file structure

**RULE 6: "A BEAT." USAGE**
Use "A beat." for:
- Silence that carries weight
- A revelation landing on a character
- A decision moment before dialogue
DO NOT use for transitions between scenes.

**RULE 7: MONTAGE WRITING**
For time-lapse / world-building / training sequences:
One line = one image. No conjunctions. Staccato. (Dangal technique)

**RULE 8: WEB SERIES EPISODE STRUCTURE**
Every episode must:
- Open with TEASER (hook, no explanation)
- End with cliffhanger OR emotional revelation
- Contain cross-references to season arc
- Reveal something new about a character's past OR future

## SECTION 14: THE SUB-SCENE SYSTEM — COMPLETE REFERENCE

### Aarya Sub-Scene System vs Paatal Lok Sub-Scene System

Both shows use sub-scene notation but with different PHILOSOPHIES:

**AARYA — Combined / Hybrid Notation:**
Aarya uses the slash `/` to show that scenes are MERGED or are ALTERNATING:
```
1.2/2A    — Two scenes that were originally separate, now combined
1.3/3A    — Scene 3 and its A-variant run together
7.5/A5    — Scene 5 and pre-labeled A5 merged
8.2/2A/2B — Three scenes merged into one continuous sequence
```
→ Slash = "these were separate, now combined OR alternate between"

**AARYA — Sub-scene Expansion (same location continuity):**
```
7.5    EXT. AARYA'S HOUSE. DRIVEWAY/LAWNS. DAY
7.5A   EXT. AARYA'S HOUSE. DRIVEWAY/LAWNS. DAY
7.5B   EXT. AARYA'S HOUSE. DRIVEWAY/LAWNS. DAY
7.5C   EXT. AARYA'S HOUSE. DRIVEWAY/LAWNS. DAY
7.5D   EXT. AARYA'S HOUSE. DRIVEWAY/LAWNS. DAY
```
→ Letter suffix = sub-moments within same location/time (no CUT between them)

**AARYA — Pre-episode scenes:**
```
2.A1   EXT. LOCATION. DAY.    ← scenes BEFORE main numbered sequence
2.A2   EXT. LOCATION. DAY.    ← happen before scene 2.1 in the episode
8.A1   INT. POLO CLUB. NIGHT. ← dramatic cold open before episode numbering
```
→ Letter-prefix (A1, A2) = scenes that were added BEFORE the story begins

**PAATAL LOK — Simple Letter Variants:**
```
5.1A   OMITTED               ← original scene, deleted
5.1B   INT. HOUSE. NIGHT.    ← replacement scene A
5.1C   EXT. STREET. NIGHT.   ← replacement scene B
4.12A  INT. OFFICE FLOOR.    ← same moment, location splits
4.12B  INT. CABIN. DAY.      ← continuation in adjacent space
```
→ Letter suffix = original scene replaced/split, NOT expansion of same scene

**PAATAL LOK — PC Suffix (Phone Call):**
```
3.4    EXT. BUS. DAY.        ← Hathi Ram on bus (receiver)
3.4PC  INT. POLICE STATION.  ← Tokas calling (same time, parallel space)
7.4    EXT. BUS DEPOT.       ← Hathi Ram (receiver)
7.4PC  INT. SHO'S CABIN.     ← Virk calling (same time, parallel)
```
→ PC = "Phone Call" scene — runs in SAME TIME as parent scene

**PAATAL LOK — Montage Sub-scene Explosion:**
```
'STATION RATS' MONTAGE       ← montage title labeled in quotes
6.7A   EXT. BRIDGE - PATH.   ← montage beat 1
6.7B   EXT. BRIDGE - STAND.  ← montage beat 2
6.7C   EXT. BRIDGE - SLEEP.  ← montage beat 3
...
6.7L   EXT. BRIDGE - STAND.  ← montage beat 12 (A through L!)
```
→ Named montages get their OWN scene numbers. Each beat = one sub-scene.
→ Montage name ALWAYS in quotes with MONTAGE suffix.

### OMITTED Scene Handling:

**Aarya style:** `3.2A **OMITTED**` — bold, double asterisks
**Paatal Lok style:** `5.1A  OMITTED  5.1A *` — plain text, scene number repeated

Both styles: The deleted scene number is KEPT in sequence. Never renumber.
Why: Continuity — if someone has a printed draft, they can find the deletion.

---

## SECTION 15: SUB-LOCATION TECHNIQUE (Paatal Lok)

Paatal Lok uses UNDERLINED CAPS sub-location labels to move camera/action WITHIN a continuing scene without creating a new scene number. This is the most elegant technique for managing multi-location scenes efficiently.

**Format:**
```
LOCATION NAME:
```
(underlined, at left margin, followed by colon — NOT a new scene heading)

**Full Examples from Script:**

```
2.2   INT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

      [Action in interrogation room...]
      Tokas' confidence wavers. He turns to throw a quick look back towards –

      OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM:

      Outside which – Hathi Ram and Ansari stand watching the show.
```

```
4.7   EXT. POLICE HQ - CORRIDOR - DAY

      [Action in corridor...]

      DOWN THE CORRIDOR:

      Lugging the damned bag, Hathi Ram somehow manages to catch up...
```

```
5.5   EXT. JAMUNA PAAR POLICE STATION - TEA STALL - DAY

      [Hathi Ram outside...]

      THE TEA STALL: From there, he sees – Ansari shaking hands...
```

```
6.1A  INT./EXT. TRAIN - SLEEPER CLASS COACH - NIGHT

      IN A COUPE:

      GHULAM MASOOD, 38, and his two SONS...
```

```
7.5   EXT. DELHI HIGHWAY - MOVING BUS - NIGHT

      INSIDE THE BUS: A sleepless Hathi Ram sits flipping...
```

```
8.4   EXT. CHITRAKOOT - RALLY MAIDAAN - DAY

      ON THE STAGE:

      Bajpayee holds center stage.

      [Later in same scene:]

      IN THE WINGS: Shukla finds what he's looking for...

      ON THE DIAS:

      Bajpayee struggles to come up with a satisfying answer.
```

**Rule**: Use sub-location when you want to show SIMULTANEOUS or SEQUENTIAL action in adjacent spaces WITHOUT cutting. It keeps the scene number intact while moving the camera.

---

## SECTION 16: INLINE PRODUCTION NOTES

Paatal Lok uses inline italic+underline notes to communicate script changes directly in the body of the script — visible to all departments:

```
Note: Changed from Day to Night.
Note: Location changed.
Note: Scene 5.6 and earlier Scene 5.7 have been combined into
      the same location and earlier scene 5.7 has been deleted.
```

These appear:
- Immediately below the scene heading they affect
- In italic + underline (sometimes just italic)
- Marked with `*` in right margin

**When to use in generated scripts:**
When making a revision or noting that a later scene was moved to this location — add a Note: inline. Aids production clarity.

---

## SECTION 17: AARYA-SPECIFIC ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### 1. Director Alternatives in Action Lines
```
(OR she is holding the same robe in which Tej made the video)
```
→ Writer gives director an alternate option, written IN the action line in parentheses.
Used for: critical props, alternate emotional readings, backup plan.

### 2. Actor Prompt (Informal Line Placeholder)
```
ADI TO SAY: Mumma, mujhe ghar pe gun wala guard pasand nahi hai
```
→ A line the writer wants the character to say but hasn't formally scripted yet.
Rare. Appears in working drafts before the line is polished.

### 3. Bold Emphasis in Action Lines
```
**Daulat keeps seeing her leave.**
```
→ Entire sentence in bold = editorial emphasis for director/actor.
Used for: moments of crucial visual/emotional importance that must not be missed.

### 4. Strikethrough in Working Drafts
```
stops by Khan's car. Khan is angry at her and then he notices her face.
Bhairon about to say something, Khan stops him ~~her~~ as if he knows
something is wrong
```
→ Crossed-out text = revision in progress. Original word kept visible for reference.
This appears in shooting drafts sent to set.

### 5. Simultaneous Dialogue (Two Characters Simultaneously)
```
           VEER                         ADITYA
Bag de. I want to check it    Mere paas nahin hai, Bhaiya.
myself.                        Mamma!
```
→ Side-by-side columns = characters speaking over each other simultaneously.
Used sparingly for: chaos scenes, arguments, overlapping emotion.

### 6. INTERCUT — Two Notations
```
PROSE VERSION: We intercut between Aarya's home and Tej's office.
HEADING VERSION: **INTERCUT** (bold, on its own line)
```
→ Both are valid. Prose version = establish the intercut at the start.
Bold heading = continue the intercut pattern further in the same scene.

---

## SECTION 18: OPENING COLD OPEN PATTERNS — 9 PAATAL LOK EPISODES

Every Paatal Lok episode cold open follows ONE of these 5 strategies:

**1. HUMOROUS SETUP → SHOCK (Ep 2)**
```
EXT. YAMUNA RIVER BANK - DAY
Man defecating by river (janeu tied to ear, bhajan on phone).
A SCUBA DIVER EXPLODES out of the water.
MAN: O bhenchod!
→ Title: LOST AND FOUND
```

**2. EXTREME VIOLENCE AS BACKSTORY (Ep 3)**
```
EXT. CHITRAKOOT SCHOOL GATES - DAY
Schoolboys walking in. One telling a joke.
YOUNG TYAGI (17) attacks with hammer. Vicious killing.
SLAM FADE TO BLACK → Title: A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE
```

**3. STREET LIFE MEETS PLOT (Ep 4)**
```
EXT. OLD DELHI RAILWAY STATION - DAY
Rough Kid and Cute Kid working together — pickpocket con.
→ Connects to Cheeni/Kaaliya backstory
FADE OUT → Title: SLEEPLESS IN SEELAMPUR
```

**4. FAMILY VIOLENCE → IMMEDIATE PRESENT (Ep 5)**
```
INT. LOWER MIDDLE CLASS HOUSE - NIGHT
Father forces khichadi on son. Son defiant. Slap. Son runs.
Car nearly hits him. Father catches him. Slaps again.
→ Title: TRUTHS & DARES
```

**5. HISTORICAL FLASHBACK → THEME REVEAL (Ep 6)**
```
INT./EXT. TRAIN - SLEEPER CLASS - NIGHT (1992)
Muslim family and Hindu woman on train.
Woman vomits at smell of their food.
EXT. PLATFORM: Kar Sevaks with saffron bandanas approach.
FADE TO BLACK → Title: OF FATHERS AND SONS
```

**6. POWER DISPLAY IN JUNGLE (Ep 7)**
```
ON BLACK: sounds of forest, heavy breathing, feet on leaves.
FADE IN: Gwala Gujjar — dangerous man, leads blindfolded Doctor.
Doctor sees Masterji's shoes. Falls in reverence.
→ Title: BADLANDS
```

**7. INTIMATE VULNERABILITY → CONNECTION (Ep 8)**
```
INT. KOLKATA RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Middle-aged Shukla: bored, wife chattering.
Smoker's lounge: Beautiful disturbed woman writing poem.
Shukla recites Urdu poetry to her. Connection begins.
→ Title: BLACK WIDOW (the woman's alias = episode title)
```

**THE PATTERN:**
- Cold open is NEVER connected to the main plot's present timeline
- It either: (a) Shows past that explains current villain, (b) Shows present world that mirrors the theme, (c) Introduces a NEW character who will matter later
- Duration: 1-4 pages maximum
- Ends with: FADE TO BLACK or SLAM FADE TO BLACK

---

## SECTION 19: SONG / POETRY AS DIALOGUE

Paatal Lok Ep 8 (Sudip Sharma) includes an entire Urdu poem as dialogue:

```
                    SHUKLA JI (O.S.) (CONT'D)
            Thodi tu tooti si,
            Thoda main toota sa...
            Raat teri jaagi si,
            Din mera sota sa,
            Thodi tu roti si,
            Thoda main rota sa...
            Hai duniya se tu khafaa,
            Main khud se rootha sa,
            Thodi tu tooti si,
            Thoda main toota sa...
            Ho jaaye yun kabhi,
            Mil jaaye tu kahin,
            Fir tu bhi poori si,
            Fir main bhi poora sa...
```

**Rules for song/poem in script:**
- Each line = its own script line (not one dialogue block)
- Formatted as regular dialogue with character name header
- `(O.S.)` if character is speaking while camera is elsewhere
- Song title or first line should be mentioned in action before dialogue starts
- The EMOTION it creates in the scene must be clear from action lines around it

---

## SECTION 20: ON BLACK — AUDIO OPENING

Paatal Lok Ep 7 (Sudip Sharma) opens with black screen + sound design BEFORE first scene:

```
ON BLACK:

SOUND of feet walking on dry leaves. Heavy breathing.
SOUNDS of nature – a bird calls somewhere. Kinda ominous.
And then – a hassled HUMAN VOICE –

            DOCTOR (O.S.)
    Aur... aur kitni door hai maharaj?

FADE IN:

7.1   EXT. CHITRAKOOT JUNGLE - DAY
```

**When to use:**
- Opens on sound/voice to create mystery before revealing location
- Creates disorientation = audience is "blind" with the character
- Best for: mystery entries, blindfolded/captive POV, dream sequences
- Always followed by `FADE IN:` before first scene number

---

## SECTION 21: BACK-REFERENCE TECHNIQUE

Both Aarya and Paatal Lok use explicit back-references in action lines — naming which episode/scene a character appeared in previously:

**Paatal Lok examples:**
```
"His eyes go to a figure suspiciously looking around. It's the
Dark Man we saw earlier in Episode 2."

"LITTLE KAALIYA (10) who we saw as the ROUGH KID in Episode 4,
jumps into the train..."

"An 8-year old boy crying in a corner. We've seen him earlier
as the CUTE KID in Episode 4. We now know he's LITTLE CHEENI."

"Hathi Ram's eyes go to – a man in the wings. We've met
SHUKLA JI before in the Episode header."
```

**Aarya examples:**
```
"as instructed by Khan in the previous episode"
```

**Rules:**
- Reference the episode number directly: "in Episode 4", "earlier in Episode 2"
- Reference the character's OLD NAME if they had a different name: "who we saw as the ROUGH KID"
- Use "we now know he's [NAME]" to bridge audience knowledge gap
- This is a PRODUCTION NOTE as much as a creative note — ensures crew consistency
