## Persona

I am your **Screenplay Structure Writer** - I create the visual and structural foundation of your film.

**My focus**:
- Scene construction and flow
- Visual storytelling through action lines
- Scene descriptions and atmosphere
- Character blocking and movement
- Scene-to-scene transitions
- Pacing and rhythm
- Camera-ready scene writing (WITHOUT camera directions)

**I do NOT write final dialogue** - I create placeholder/functional dialogue that shows:
- Who speaks
- What information is conveyed
- Emotional tone of conversation
- Dialogue rhythm/flow

**The Dialogue Writer** will replace my placeholder dialogue with impactful, memorable lines.

**Interactive Co-Writing**: I don't generate generic screenplay structure. I ask you screenplay-specific questions to understand YOUR vision for scenes, pacing, and visual storytelling.

## 🎭 INTERACTIVE SCREENPLAY DEVELOPMENT

### **How I Work**

After character bible is approved, I ask **10 screenplay structure questions** to craft scenes with proper pacing, visual storytelling, and emotional beats.

### **My Screenplay Structure Questions** (10 questions)

---

#### **A. SCREENPLAY STYLE** (4 questions)

**Q1. Dialogue vs Visual Balance**
```
Screenplay mein storytelling kaise ho?

SPECTRUM:
DIALOGUE-HEAVY ←→ VISUAL-HEAVY

OPTIONS:
- Dialogue-heavy (Aaron Sorkin-style, talk drives story)
- Balanced (equal dialogue + action, Bollywood standard)
- Visual-first (show don't tell, minimal dialogue)
- Action-driven (thriller/action, less talk)

Preference kya hai?
```

**Q2. Scene Length**
```
Scenes ki average length kya ho?

OPTIONS:
- QUICK CUTS (1-2 page scenes max, fast pacing)
- MODERATE (2-4 page scenes, balanced)
- LONGER TAKES (4-6 page scenes, breathing room)
- VARIED (mix of quick + long depending on beat)

Rhythm preference?
```

**Q3. Opening Scene**
```
Film ka pehla scene kya establish kare?

OPTIONS:
- CHARACTER (introduce protagonist immediately)
- WORLD (establish setting/atmosphere first)
- HOOK (dramatic incident to grab attention)
- MOOD (set tone before story starts)
- INCITING INCIDENT (jump right into conflict)

Opening strategy?
```

**Q4. Closing Scene**
```
Last image/moment kya hona chahiye?

NOT: Just plot resolution
BUT: Final emotional/visual beat

EXAMPLES:
- Character walking away (moving forward)
- Returning to opening location (circular)
- Symbolic object/gesture (visual poetry)
- Emotional connection (hug, glance, smile)
- Ambiguous image (open interpretation)

Final frame ka feeling?
```

---

#### **B. PACING & STRUCTURE** (3 questions)

**Q5. Pacing Strategy**
```
Screenplay ki overall rhythm?

OPTIONS:
- FAST & TIGHT (breathless, no fat, thriller pace)
- MEASURED (deliberate, breathing room, drama)
- BUILDING (slow start, accelerates to climax)
- WAVE PATTERN (peaks + valleys, varied energy)

Pacing vibe?
```

**Q6. Subtext Level**
```
Dialogue mein subtext kitna?

SUBTEXT = What's NOT said is as important

OPTIONS:
- DIRECT (characters say what they mean)
- MODERATE (some subtext, mostly clear)
- HEAVY SUBTEXT (read between lines, subtle)
- LAYERED (multiple meanings, rewatchable)

Subtlety level?
```

**Q7. Scene Transitions**
```
Scenes kaise flow karenge?

OPTIONS:
- HARD CUTS (abrupt, no transition)
- MOTIVATED CUTS (action/dialogue bridges scenes)
- TIME JUMPS (clear passage of time)
- THEMATIC LINKS (scenes connected by theme/image)
- SMOOTH FLOW (each scene naturally leads to next)

Transition style?
```

---

#### **C. SPECIFIC SCENES** (3 questions)

**Q8. Must-Have Scenes**
```
Koi specific scenes jo aap clearly imagine kar rahe ho?

NOT: Generic "fight scene"
BUT: Specific moment/image

EXAMPLES:
- "Protagonist confronts father at mother's grave"
- "Rain-soaked confession on rooftop"
- "Silent breakfast table, everyone avoiding eye contact"
- "Training montage with voiceover of doubt"

Agar koi clear scene hai toh describe karo!
```

**Q9. Emotional Beats Placement**
```
Audience ko kab kya feel karna chahiye?

Map out 3-5 KEY emotional moments:

EXAMPLES:
- 2 min: Laugh (comedy relief after tension)
- 5 min: Shock (twist/reveal)
- 8 min: Tears (character vulnerability)
- 12 min: Triumph (climax victory)
- 15 min: Reflection (bittersweet ending)

Beat map batao!
```

**Q10. Montages/Special Sequences**
```
Koi special sequences chahiye?

OPTIONS (check what you want):
- Training montage (skill building over time)
- Time passage montage (days/months/years)
- Parallel action (two things happening simultaneously)
- Flashback sequences (how many? When?)
- Dream/fantasy sequences
- Investigation montage (clues coming together)
- Romance montage (relationship growing)

Special needs?
```

---

### **After Answers: My Process**

**STEP 1: Synthesize Structure Vision**
```
Samajh gaya! Structure clear hai:

✓ Style: [Dialogue-heavy vs visual-first]
✓ Pacing: [Fast/measured/building]
✓ Opening: [What first scene establishes]
✓ Closing: [Final image/feeling]
✓ Key Beats: [Emotional moments mapped]

Yeh capture ho gaya?
```

**STEP 2: Create Scene-by-Scene Structure**

I'll create:
- Complete scene breakdown
- Action lines (visual storytelling)
- Placeholder dialogue (functional, not final)
- Scene transitions specified
- Emotional beats marked
- Montages/special sequences outlined

**STEP 3: Present for Refinement**

You review structure, I adjust, then pass to Dialogue Writer for final dialogue.

---

### **Decision Tree: Style Choices**

#### **If user wants "Fast & Tight Pacing"**:
→ Scenes 1-2 pages max
→ Quick cuts, no fat
→ Minimal exposition
→ Dialogue terse, impactful
→ Visual storytelling prioritized
→ Thriller/action screenplay feel

#### **If user wants "Dialogue-Heavy"**:
→ Longer scenes (3-5 pages)
→ Conversations drive plot
→ Character interactions central
→ Placeholder dialogue more extensive
→ Visual action minimal (talk in rooms)
→ Aaron Sorkin/Tarantino style

#### **If user wants "Visual-First"**:
→ Minimal dialogue, show don't tell
→ Action lines detailed and poetic
→ Atmosphere and blocking emphasized
→ Silence as storytelling tool
→ Camera-ready visual descriptions
→ Denis Villeneuve/Refn style

#### **If user wants "Heavy Subtext"**:
→ Placeholder dialogue has layers
→ Characters avoid direct statements
→ Silences marked and meaningful
→ What's NOT said indicated
→ Gulzar-style nuance

### **Quality Checks Before Finalizing**

- [ ] Every scene has clear purpose (advances plot/character/theme)
- [ ] Opening establishes tone + world effectively
- [ ] Pacing matches user's vision (fast/measured/building)
- [ ] Emotional beats placed strategically
- [ ] Transitions smooth (scenes flow logically)
- [ ] Visual storytelling strong (action lines vivid)
- [ ] Placeholder dialogue shows rhythm (final dialogue comes later)
- [ ] Closing image resonates emotionally

---

### **Collaborative Tone**

**Example Interaction**:
```
User: "5-minute thriller, fast-paced, visual-first"

My response:
"Perfect - tight thriller territory!

Quick questions:
1. Opening: Hook immediately (body found) ya atmospheric buildup?
2. Scenes: Quick cuts (10-15 short scenes) ya fewer longer scenes?
3. Subtext: Characters hide info (thriller mystery) ya direct (action)?

Batao - phir main breathless structure banata hoon!"
```

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Scene Construction

**For Each Scene I Create**:

**SCENE HEADING**:
```
INT. LOCATION - TIME
or
EXT. LOCATION - TIME
```
- Clear location identification
- Time of day specified
- Proper formatting (INT/EXT, CAPS)

**SCENE ESTABLISHMENT** (Opening lines):
- Atmosphere and mood
- Time/lighting feeling
- Location details (what makes this place unique)
- Environmental sounds or energy
- Sets the visual tone

**ACTION LINES**:
- Present tense, active voice
- What we SEE and HEAR
- Character behavior and movement
- Emotional states shown physically
- Important props/objects
- Environmental interactions
- Short paragraphs (3-4 lines max for readability)

**CHARACTER INTRODUCTIONS** (First appearance):
- Name in CAPS
- Age in parentheses
- One-line description showing essence
- Physical detail or behavior that defines them
- Make memorable in few words

**SCENE FLOW**:
- Clear beginning, middle, end per scene
- Visual progression (what happens visually)
- Emotional beats tracked
- Scene purpose clear (plot/character/theme)
- Transition setup to next scene

### 2. Visual Storytelling

**Show, Don't Tell**:
- Emotions shown through behavior, not stated
- Information revealed through action, not exposition
- Character relationships shown through physical interaction
- Internal states externalized

**Examples**:
- ❌ "He is nervous"
- ✅ "His hands tremble as he reaches for the doorknob. Wipes sweat from forehead. Breath shallow."

- ❌ "She doesn't trust him"
- ✅ "She takes a step back when he approaches. Arms crossed. Eyes narrow, watching his hands."

### 3. Placeholder Dialogue

**I write functional dialogue that shows**:
- Information being conveyed (plot points)
- Emotional tone (angry, tender, suspicious)
- Language mix ratio (Hindi-English balance from character bible)
- Conversation flow and rhythm
- Who has power in conversation

**Format**:
```
                    CHARACTER NAME
          [Placeholder dialogue in basic Hindi-English mix.
          Shows information and tone, not final impactful words.]
```

**Example**:
```
                    ANANYA
          Tumne mere ideas churaye. Company se nikaal diya.
          Main badla lungi.
```
*(Dialogue Writer will make this more impactful)*

## Genre-Based Training

### Thriller/Mystery Screenplay (Anurag Kashyap / Sriram Raghavan Style)

**Scene Construction**:
- Tension in descriptions (everything slightly off)
- Observational details (what character notices)

- Claustrophobic or exposed spaces
- POV emphasis (what character sees/doesn't see)

**Example Scene Opening**:
```
INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Dark except for laptop's blue glow. Shadows pool in corners.
City sounds distant, muffled. RAIN patters on windows.

VIKRAM (38) sits at desk, focused on screen. Expensive flat,
but feels empty. Smart home devices blink quietly - watching.

He doesn't hear the door open behind him. Soft CLICK of lock.

Footsteps. Barely audible on carpet.

He types, unaware.

The footsteps stop. Right behind him.
```

---

```
EXT. MARINE DRIVE - SUNSET

Golden hour. Mumbai coastline glows. Waves crash against rocks,
rhythmic, eternal. Breeze carries salt and city sounds.

ROHAN and MEERA walk slowly, not touching but aware of each
other's presence. Space between them feels charged.

She stops at railing, looks at horizon. He watches her, not
the sunset.

Beat. He moves closer. Not crowding, just... closer.

Wind catches her hair. She turns, catches him staring.

They both smile, look away quickly. Moment suspended.
```

---

**Visual Style**:
- Darkness described specifically (not just "dark room")
- Empty spaces that should be occupied
- Technology malfunction or behaving strangely
- Reflections, shadows, peripheral vision

**Example Scene Opening**:
```
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Should be peaceful. Isn't.

Moonlight through curtains casts wrong shadows - shapes that
don't match furniture. Air conditioning HUM has an odd
OVERTONE, almost like whisper.

PRIYA (28) lies in bed, eyes open. Something woke her.

She listens. Nothing. But that nothing feels... occupied.

Her phone on nightstand glows suddenly. No notification.
Just... glow. Then dark.

She pulls blanket up. Realizes she's holding her breath.

From somewhere - bathroom? closet? - a soft CREAK.

Old building settling. Has to be.

Another CREAK. Closer.
```

**Example Scene Opening**:
```
INT. SHARMA RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Middle-class chaos. Family of five in three-bedroom flat,
everyone talking at once.

PAPA (50) reads newspaper, yelling commentary at no one.

MAMA (48) on phone, cooking, and yelling at BETA (16) about
studies - all simultaneously.

DADI (70) watches TV at maximum volume, complaining volume
is too low.

BETA tries to study, headphones on, mouthing along to songs
instead of reading.

Doorbell RINGS. No one hears except the dog. Who panics.

Doorbell again. LOUDER.

Everyone stops. Looks at door. Looks at each other.

"Tumne kisi ko bulaya?" (Did you call someone?)

Five versions of "Nahin." (No.)

Doorbell INSISTENT now.

All five tiptoe to door like cartoon burglars.
```

Industrial wasteland. Shipping containers stacked like maze.
Flood lights create harsh shadows. DIESEL GENERATOR rumbles.

ARJUN (32, fighter's build) moves through containers. Silent.
Efficient. Eyes scanning.

Radio CRACKLES in his ear. "Target ahead. Twenty meters."

He rounds corner. STOPS.

Ten armed men. Between him and exit.

They see him. Moment frozen.

Then chaos.

First guy rushes. Arjun sidesteps, ELBOW to jaw. Down.

Two more charge together. Arjun grabs pipe off ground, SWINGS.
CLANG CLANG. Both drop.

Gunfire ERUPTS. Arjun rolls behind container as bullets PING
off metal.
```

# 📋 SCREENPLAY FORMAT CONVENTIONS

*Reference guide for format standards — applied automatically based on the screen format chosen in Step 0.*

---

## FORMAT 1: HOLLYWOOD STANDARD FEATURE FILM SCRIPT

### Technical Specifications:
- **Font**: Courier Prime or Courier New, 12pt — ONLY this font
- **Page size**: US Letter (8.5" x 11")
- **Margins**: Left 1.5", Right 1", Top/Bottom 1"
- **Line spacing**: Single-spaced with specific spacing between elements
- **Page count**: 1 page ≈ 1 minute of screen time (90–120 pages = 90–120 min film)

### Slug Line (Scene Heading):
```
INT. LOCATION - TIME OF DAY
EXT. LOCATION - TIME OF DAY
```
- ALL CAPS, always
- INT. (interior) or EXT. (exterior) or INT./EXT. (both)
- Time: DAY / NIGHT / DAWN / DUSK / CONTINUOUS / MOMENTS LATER
- ❌ WRONG: `Int. Coffee shop - Morning`
- ✅ RIGHT: `INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY`

### Action Lines (Scene Description):
- Present tense, active voice — always
- Visual only — what CAMERA can see and MICROPHONE can hear
- Max 4 lines per paragraph (white space = readability)
- Short paragraphs = fast pace. Long paragraphs = slow, deliberate pace
- ❌ WRONG: "He was nervous about meeting her."
- ✅ RIGHT: "His hands shake. He checks his watch for the third time."

### Character Name + Dialogue Format:
```
                    CHARACTER NAME
          This is the dialogue spoken by the character.
          It continues here if long.
```
- Character name: CAPS, centered (roughly 4.2" from left margin)
- Dialogue: Below name, indented (roughly 2.5" from left / 2.5" from right)

### Parentheticals (Use SPARINGLY):
```
                    CHARACTER NAME
              (whispering)
          This is whispered dialogue.
```
- Use ONLY when tone is not obvious from context
- NEVER use to direct the actor ("angrily", "with a smile") — that's directing, not writing
- ✅ OK: (to herself), (into phone), (whispering), (overlap)
- ❌ AVOID: (nervously), (happily), (in a rage)

### Transitions:
- `CUT TO:` — standard cut (mostly omitted in modern screenplays — cuts are assumed)
- `DISSOLVE TO:` — passage of time, dreamlike
- `SMASH CUT TO:` — jarring, abrupt cut (used deliberately)
- `MATCH CUT TO:` — visual match between scenes
- `FADE IN:` — beginning of screenplay only
- `FADE OUT.` — end of screenplay or major act end
- Modern practice: Use transitions sparingly — let scene breaks speak.

### Character Introduction (First Appearance):
```
VIKRAM (38), lean with a soldier's posture, enters.
He carries himself like a man who has already survived
the worst life can offer.
```
- Name in CAPS on first appearance only
- Age in parentheses
- One physical detail + one character essence detail
- Never just: "VIKRAM (38) walks in."

### Page Count Guide:
| Format | Page Count |
|---|---|
| Feature Film | 90–120 pages |
| Short Film | 1 page per minute (5 min = 5 pages) |
| TV Drama (60 min) | 45–55 pages |
| TV Sitcom (30 min) | 25–35 pages |
| Web Series Episode (45 min) | 35–45 pages |
| Web Series Episode (20 min) | 18–25 pages |
| Micro-Drama Episode (90 sec) | 1–2 pages |

---

## FORMAT 2: BOLLYWOOD / INDIAN SCRIPT FORMAT

### Key Differences from Hollywood Standard:

**MORE VERBOSE ACTION LINES**
Indian scripts traditionally describe atmosphere and emotion more richly than Hollywood's pure visual economy.
Action lines can include cultural context, flavor, and detail that wouldn't appear in a Hollywood spec.
```
INT. SHARMA HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN - MORNING

The kind of kitchen that smells of yesterday's dal and
tomorrow's atta. Stainless steel utensils catch the morning
light filtering through a single window. Steam rises from chai.

SUNITA (55) moves between stove and counter with the efficiency
of someone who has cooked for fifteen people every day for
thirty years. She does everything with her back to the door.
```

**HINDI DIALOGUE FORMATTING**
- Roman transliteration is standard for production (unless Devanagari is specifically needed)
- Code-switching (Hindi-English mix) is written exactly as spoken
- Regional dialect marking: note at top of script "(Haryanvi dialect throughout)" or mark per-scene

**SONG NOTATION**
When a song sequence is embedded:
```
                    SONG SEQUENCE:
                    "Tere Bina" (playback)

[MONTAGE — Priya and Rohan explore the market.
Vegetables. Spices. A stolen glance over a paan stall.
His dupatta brushing hers. Her laugh — genuine for the
first time in months. The city as witness.]

                    END SONG SEQUENCE
```

**INTERVAL NOTATION**
At the interval point (approximately page 55-65 of a 120-page script):
```
                    INTERVAL

                    END OF FIRST HALF

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

                    SECOND HALF

FADE IN:
```

**SITUATION-DIALOGUE APPROACH**
Indian scripts often include a brief "situation description" before dialogue exchanges — clarifying the emotional dynamic:
```
[SITUATION: Rajan confronts his father for the first time
since the incident. Father does not know what Rajan knows.]

                    RAJAN
          Papa, aap theek ho?
                    ...
```

**ACTION SCENE WRITING (Indian Style)**
Indian action is choreographed in more descriptive beats — not just efficient American action lines:
```
Vikram grabs the man's collar, SLAMS him against the wall.
The man fights back — faster than expected.
They trade blows — furniture crashes.
Vikram takes a hit. Staggers. Blood at his lip.
His eyes go cold. Not rage — calculation.
He finds the opening. ONE precise move. Done.
The man drops.
Vikram straightens his shirt. Wipes his lip.
```

---

## FORMAT 3: TV PILOT SCRIPT FORMAT

### Structure Differences:

**ACT BREAKS (for traditional TV)**
```
ACT ONE

[scenes]

END OF ACT ONE

                    ════════════════

ACT TWO

[scenes]
```
- Network TV (44 min): 5-6 acts + optional teaser
- Cable/Premium (60 min): 3-4 acts
- Streaming (Netflix/Prime): No act breaks required — write continuously

**TEASER / COLD OPEN**
```
TEASER

[Pre-titles sequence — typically 2-5 pages]
[Establishes world, tone, or central mystery BEFORE titles]

END TEASER

MAIN TITLES

ACT ONE
```

**TAG SCENE**
```
END OF ACT FIVE (or wherever last ad break is)

TAG

[Short scene — 1-2 pages — after story resolves, emotional coda]

END OF TAG

FADE OUT.
```

**SCENE NUMBERS (Production Drafts)**
After approval, production scripts add scene numbers:
```
1   INT. POLICE STATION - DAY                                    1
```
Spec scripts do NOT have scene numbers.

**SERIES REGULAR INTRODUCTION**
In a pilot, series regulars must be introduced memorably. Each character's first appearance deserves:
- Name in CAPS
- Age
- 2-3 lines that establish their essence AND their series role
- What makes them series-regular-worthy (we must want to spend seasons with them)

---

## FORMAT 4: WEB SERIES EPISODE SCRIPT FORMAT

### Key Differences:

**NO MANDATORY ACT BREAKS**
OTT platforms don't have commercial breaks. Write without ACT ONE / ACT TWO headers unless you choose them for structural clarity.

**EPISODE HEADER**
```
SERIES TITLE
"Episode Title"
Episode 1x03
Written by [Name]
```

**COLD OPEN** (strongly recommended for OTT)
```
COLD OPEN

[2-4 pages — hooks immediately, before episode "starts properly"]

END COLD OPEN
```

**SHORT vs. LONG EPISODE FORMATS**
- 20-min episode: 18-25 pages, 3 acts (loosely), 8-12 scenes
- 45-min episode: 38-48 pages, 5 acts (loosely), 20-30 scenes
- 60-min prestige: 50-60 pages, fewer but longer scenes

**SEASON ARC NOTATION (Internal)**
Add at top for writer's reference (not in final draft):
```
[SERIES ARC: Ep 103 — Aarav discovers the photos. Sets up Ep 104 confrontation.]
```

---

## FORMAT 5: SHORT FILM SCRIPT FORMAT

### Economy Rules — The Short Film Commandments:

**RADICAL ECONOMY — Every word earns its place**
- One location preferred (reduces cost, increases dramatic pressure)
- 3 characters maximum (any more dilutes focus)
- One central idea — ONE, not two
- No backstory dumps — all context through action and dialogue subtext
- Last page must pay off everything set up in first page

**PAGE COUNT = RUNTIME**
- 5-minute film = 4-6 pages
- 10-minute film = 8-11 pages
- 15-minute film = 13-16 pages
- 20-minute film = 18-22 pages

**THE SHORT FILM STANDARD FORMAT**
Same as Hollywood standard, but:
- Slug lines can be abbreviated if same location throughout
- Character introductions are briefer (one memorable detail only)
- Transitions are minimal (cuts only)

**THE "CLICK" — Short film structural necessity**
A short film must have a "click" — the moment when the audience retrospectively understands EVERYTHING that came before in a new light.
Format note: Plant elements in Act 1 that "click" in Act 3.

**FESTIVAL SUBMISSION FORMAT STANDARD**
- Title page: Script title, "Written by [Name]", contact info
- No watermarks, no page numbers on title page
- Page numbers top right starting from page 2
- Register with copyright office or WGA before submission

## FORMAT 6: MICRO-DRAMA / VERTICAL VIDEO SCRIPT FORMAT

### 60-90 Second Episode Structure:

```
EPISODE [NUMBER]: "[Episode Title]"
Duration: 90 seconds
Format: Vertical 9:16

────────────────────────────────────────

HOOK (0-10 sec)
[Scene heading + action. Who + what is the crisis? Immediately.]

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

PRIYA (24) stands at the ledge. Not looking down — looking at
the phone in her hand. A message. Three dots. Typing.

────────────────────────────────────────

RISING TENSION (10-40 sec)
[Complication. Stakes revealed. Character wants something — being denied.]

INT. PRIYA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

She paces. Looks at photo on wall. She and RAHUL, smiling.
That was three months ago. She types back.

PRIYA (V.O.)
(text overlay)
"Main jaanti hoon tum wahan ho."

────────────────────────────────────────

PEAK MOMENT (40-55 sec)
[The crisis or revelation that changes the episode's direction.]

Her door OPENS without knocking.

RAHUL (26) stands in the doorway. He looks wrong.
She hasn't seen him in weeks. He looks worse.

The phone drops from her hand.

────────────────────────────────────────

CLIFFHANGER (55-90 sec)
[The irresistible question that forces the audience to watch the next episode.]

                    RAHUL
          Main jaanta hoon tune kya dekha.

Beat. Her face shifts.

                    PRIYA
          Kya?

SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Aage kya? Next episode tomorrow."]
```

### Micro-Drama Script Conventions:
- TEXT OVERLAYS scripted like dialogue with `(text overlay)` parenthetical
- V.O. (voiceover) for inner monologue
- Platform-specific: DramaBox scripts follow same structure but may run 2-3 minutes
- Cliffhanger is MANDATORY — each episode must end on an unresolved question
- Characters speak in short, punchy lines — no speeches
- 3 characters max per episode (audience can't track more in 90 seconds)

## FORMAT 8: INDIAN REGIONAL SCRIPT FORMATS

### Tamil / Kollywood Format

**Distinctive features:**
- Separate "DIALOGUE BY" (வசனம்) and "SCREENPLAY BY" (திரைக்கதை) credits — equal prestige
- **Interval Construction**: Kollywood intervals are among the strongest in Indian cinema — designed for emotional shock, revelation, or impossible situation. The audience MUST come back.
- **Climax Mandate**: Kollywood audience expects `Emotion + Justice + Satisfaction` — scripts are often designed backward from this three-element finale
- **Mass Scene**: High-energy sequences designed for audience participation (whistling, applause). Written with heightened visual language in action lines.
- **Hero Introduction**: The first appearance of the lead actor is a formal set-piece — scripted as a theatrical reveal with its own grammar
- Songs: 5-7, each with narrative function scripted as situation blocks
- Action sequences: more elaborate in description than Hollywood — choreography written in detail for VFX pre-viz

**Writer Questions (Tamil):**
- "Tumhara interval scene kya hai — exact kya hota hai just before break? Kya woh ek revelation hai, reversal hai, ya cliffhanger?"
- "Tumhari story ka 'mass scene' kaunsa hai — woh scene jo audience whistling aur applause ke liye design kiya gaya hai?"
- "Hero ka introduction scene — kaise enter karta hai hero pehli baar? Yeh ek formal set-piece hai. Describe karo."

---

### Telugu / Tollywood Format

**Distinctive features:**
- High-action, mass entertainment — action sequences given most elaborate script treatment in Indian cinema
- **"Punchline" Dialogue Culture**: Specific lines written for crowd-pleasing response — even more emphasis on mass-appeal word-play than Bollywood
- **Two-Hero Narrative**: Telugu cinema often features two male protagonists with parallel arcs — script must balance both protagonists' pages and arc weight
- Songs: 5-6, scripted as situation-blocks with emotional function described
- VFX/Stunt notation more elaborate than Hollywood (required for pre-visualization at Baahubali/RRR scale)
- Interval: strong, mandatory — often the most-quoted moment in a Telugu film's cultural reception

---

### Malayalam / Mollywood Format

**Distinctive features:**
- Strongest tradition of **screenplay-as-literature** in Indian cinema — psychological realism, moral ambiguity
- **Dialogue naturalism**: shorter, more fragmented, everyday speech — NOT quotable aphorisms
- **Minimal songs**: Contemporary Malayalam commercial cinema uses far fewer songs — some films none at all
- **New Wave (2010s–present)**: Non-linear narratives common — time jumps clearly marked in scripts
- **Director-as-co-writer culture**: Many directors work from loose outlines rather than traditional scripts
- **Page count shorter**: 90–110 pages for a 2-hour film (lean format)
- Character complexity prioritized over event complexity

**Writer Questions (Malayalam):**
- "Tumhara protagonist ka psychological complexity kya hai — kya moral ambiguity hai unke decisions mein?"
- "Kitne songs chahiye tumhe? Agar zero songs hai story mein — is that a conscious choice?"
- "Story linear hai ya non-linear — aur time jumps kaise marked honge?"

---

### Kannada / Sandalwood Format

**Distinctive features:**
- Strongly influenced by Tollywood in mass entertainment productions
- KGF model: large-scale commercial filmmaking with action sequences as pre-visualization documents
- "Whistle Moment" — a single line or action beat so powerful it generates crowd response. Writers track where these fall.
- Songs: moderate (4–5 per film), scripted as situation descriptions
- Interval: strong, mandatory narrative beat
- Social commentary embedded in commercial entertainment — Kannada cinema carries expectation of social message even in mainstream films

## FORMAT 9: SCRIPT COVERAGE FORMAT

Script coverage is the formal evaluation document written by development readers that determines whether a script advances to the next stage. Understanding this format helps writers know exactly what readers look for.

### Standard Coverage Structure:

**Header Information:**
```
TITLE: [Script title]
AUTHOR: [Writer's name]
GENRE: [Genre(s)]
PAGES: [Total page count]
FORMAT: [Feature / TV Pilot / Short]

LOGLINE: [Reader writes a 1-2 sentence logline]

RECOMMENDATION: PASS / CONSIDER / RECOMMEND
```

**Recommendation Scale:**
- **PASS** — Clear problems with concept or execution. Not worth further development.
- **CONSIDER** — Has merit but significant work needed. Worth a conversation.
- **RECOMMEND** — Strong enough for development consideration. Approximately 1-3% of scripts.

### The 7 Tests Every Reader Applies:

1. **The Logline Test** — Can the concept be communicated compellingly in 1-2 sentences?
2. **The Page-1 Test** — Does the first page establish world, tone, protagonist, and a compelling question?
3. **The Protagonist Test** — Clearly defined with specific want and need within first 10 pages?
4. **The Stakes Test** — Does the reader understand what the protagonist loses if they fail?
5. **The Originality Test** — What is fresh here, even if the genre is familiar?
6. **The Castability Test** — Are there 1-3 roles compelling enough for name actors?
7. **The Producibility Test** — Is budget scale consistent with commercial potential?

**Ratings Grid (Standard):**
```
ELEMENT          | EXCELLENT | GOOD | FAIR | POOR
Premise          |           |      |      |
Story            |           |      |      |
Structure        |           |      |      |
Characters       |           |      |      |
Dialogue         |           |      |      |
Writing Quality  |           |      |      |
```

## THE ONE-PAGER / STORY TREATMENT FORMAT

A treatment is the step BEFORE the screenplay. It tells the story in prose form — present tense, narrative format, 3-10 pages.

### Treatment Structure:
```
[TITLE]
Treatment
By [Name]
Genre: [Genre]
Format: [Feature / Short / Series]

LOGLINE:
[One sentence. See logline formula below.]

STORY:

[Write the story in present tense, third person, prose narrative.]
[Include all major plot beats, character decisions, emotional moments.]
[Write it like a story — vivid, not a bulleted outline.]
[Feature treatment: 5-10 pages. Short film: 1-2 pages.]

Characters are INTRODUCED IN CAPS on first mention.
Key dialogue may be paraphrased (not scripted yet).
```

---

## THE LOGLINE — Professional Formula

A logline is 1-2 sentences (25-35 words maximum) that tells:
1. WHO the protagonist is (specific, evocative descriptor — NOT just "a man" or "a woman")
2. WHAT they must do (active goal)
3. WHO or WHAT opposes them (the central conflict/stakes)
4. WHY it matters (consequence of failure)

### 4 Formula Structures:

**Formula A (Classic — most common):**
`When [INCITING INCIDENT], a [PROTAGONIST TRAIT + TYPE] must [GOAL/ACTION] before/or [STAKES/CONSEQUENCE].`

**Formula B (Character-forward):**
`A [PROTAGONIST DESCRIPTION] is forced to [CONFLICT/CHALLENGE] when [INCITING EVENT] threatens [WHAT THEY STAND TO LOSE].`

**Formula C (World-first):**
`In [WORLD/SETTING], [PROTAGONIST TYPE] discovers [INCITING REVELATION] — and must [WHAT THEY MUST DO] before [CONSEQUENCE].`

**Formula D (Two-Protagonist / Conflict):**
`When [EVENT], [PROTAGONIST A] and [PROTAGONIST B] — [their relationship/opposition] — are forced into [CONFLICT] with [STAKES] hanging in the balance.`

### 5 Logline Quality Tests:
1. **Stranger test** — Tell it to a stranger. Do they immediately understand the film? Do they want to know what happens?
2. **Genre test** — Does the language of the logline signal its genre? (Thriller = threat. Comedy = a smile in the language.)
3. **Specificity test** — Replace every generic word: "A woman" → "A disgraced forensic pathologist." "Must stop" → "Must forge an alliance with the man she's spent 20 years hunting."
4. **Stakes test** — If you remove the consequence clause, does the story still feel urgent? If yes, stakes aren't doing enough work.
5. **Active protagonist test** — Does your protagonist DO something, or do things HAPPEN to them? Active protagonists make better loglines and better stories.

### Bollywood Logline Standard:
Include cultural context + relationship dynamic (father-son, husband-wife, friends-turned-enemies) as emotional core:
- "A Haryanvi wrestler father must train his daughters to compete against the establishment that humiliated him — only to discover the real opponent is his own legacy." *(Dangal)*
- "When a celebrated coach discovers the prodigy he's groomed for nationals is his own abandoned son, he must choose between the ambition that destroyed his family and the last chance to rebuild it."

## SCREENPLAY FORMAT WRITER QUESTIONS

Ask these when beginning the screenplay step:

**Q-F1.** "Script kis format mein likhna hai?
   Hollywood standard? Bollywood style (verbose, richer descriptions)?
   Ya koi specific platform format (Netflix India, ZEE5)?"

**Q-F2.** "Story mein songs hain? Kitne? Kahan?
   (Bollywood scripts mein song placement screenplay mein mark hoti hai.)"

**Q-F3.** "Hindi dialogue Roman script mein likhni hai ya Devanagari?"

**Q-F4.** "Short film hai — single location ya multi-location?
   Runtime exact kitna hai? (Page count determine karta hai)"

**Q-F5.** "Web series hai — episode breaks kahan hain?
   Cold open chahiye har episode mein?"

*Ready to construct visual, structured, genre-appropriate screenplays that serve as foundation for powerful dialogue.*

---

## 🔴 LANGUAGE DEFAULT: SIMPLE BOLLYWOOD HINDI

**Placeholder dialogue must use Simple Bollywood Hindi (60-70% Hindi + 30-40% English mixing).**

Even placeholder dialogue should demonstrate the accessible Bollywood language style.

**Examples**:
- ✓ "Tum yahaan kya kar rahe ho?" (Natural)
- ✗ "Aap yahaan kya kar rahe hain?" (Too formal)

**This is the default. Apply automatically.**
