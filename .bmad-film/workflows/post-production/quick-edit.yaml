process:
  - step: 1
    name: "Footage Organization & Ingest"
    agent: "post-supervisor"
    action: |
      Setup post-production:
      - Create editing project
      - Ingest all footage
      - Organize by scene/shot
      - Verify footage quality (exposure, focus, audio)
      - Flag any technical issues
      - Review continuity notes
    outputs:
      - "Organized editing project"
      - "Footage verified and ready"
    duration: "1-2 hours"

  - step: 2
    name: "Review Footage & Select Takes"
    agent: "editor"
    action: |
      Review all footage:
      - Watch all takes
      - Select best performances/technical quality
      - Identify usable B-roll and cutaways
      - Note any missing coverage or issues
      - Reference Script Supervisor notes for selected takes
    outputs:
      - "Selected takes marked"
      - "Coverage assessment"
    duration: "1-2 hours"

  - step: 3
    name: "First Assembly"
    agent: "editor"
    action: |
      Build initial cut:
      - Assemble story based on shot list and creative vision
      - Focus on structure and story flow (not refinement yet)
      - Include all key story beats
      - Rough timing to target length
      - Add placeholder music/sound if helpful for pacing

    editing_priorities:
      1. Story clarity (does it make sense?)
      2. Emotional flow (does it feel right?)
      3. Pacing (does it drag or rush?)
      4. Target length (hit the time requirement)

    outputs:
      - "Assembly v1 (rough cut)"
      - "Runtime check"
    duration: "2-3 hours"

  - step: 4
    name: "Review & Feedback"
    agent: "editor"
    collaborators: ["directors-assistant", "producer"]
    action: |
      Review assembly with creative leads:
      - Screen rough cut
      - Gather feedback on story, pacing, emotion
      - Identify what's working vs. what needs adjustment
      - Prioritize changes (must-fix vs. nice-to-have)
    outputs:
      - "Feedback notes"
      - "Prioritized revision list"
    duration: "30 min - 1 hour"

  - step: 5
    name: "Refine Cut"
    agent: "editor"
    action: |
      Refine based on feedback:
      - Adjust pacing and timing
      - Optimize shot selection
      - Fine-tune transitions
      - Refine to exact target length
      - Polish story flow

    refinement_focus:
      - Tighten pacing (remove dead air, tighten reactions)
      - Enhance emotional beats (hold key moments, cut faster through transitions)
      - Smooth transitions (ensure cuts feel natural)
      - Hit exact runtime (30.0 sec, not 30.5 sec)

    outputs:
      - "Refined cut v1"
    duration: "2-3 hours"

  - step: 6
    name: "Sound Design & Music (Basic)"
    agent: "editor"
    action: |
      Add audio elements:
      - Clean dialogue (if applicable)
      - Add music (licensed or provided track)
      - Basic sound effects
      - Mix levels (dialogue clear, music balanced)
      - Ensure audio meets broadcast specs (if applicable)

    audio_priorities:
      1. Dialogue clarity (if present)
      2. Music enhances emotion without overpowering
      3. Sound effects feel natural
      4. Consistent levels (no sudden jumps)

    outputs:
      - "Cut with audio mix"
    duration: "1-2 hours"

  - step: 7
    name: "Color Correction (Basic)"
    agent: "editor"
    action: |
      Basic color grading:
      - Correct exposure and white balance
      - Match shots for consistency
      - Apply creative grade supporting visual style
      - Ensure broadcast-safe levels (if applicable)

    color_priorities:
      1. Consistency (shots match across cuts)
      2. Correct exposure (no overly dark/bright)
      3. Creative grade (mood and tone)
      4. Technical compliance (broadcast specs if needed)

    outputs:
      - "Color-corrected cut"
    duration: "1-2 hours"

  - step: 8
    name: "Add Graphics/Text (If Needed)"
    agent: "editor"
    action: |
      Add any required graphics:
      - Title cards
      - Lower thirds
      - Logo placement
      - Call-to-action text

    collaborators: ["directors-assistant", "producer"]
    action: |
      Final quality check:
      - Screen complete cut
      - Check technical specs (resolution, aspect ratio, runtime)
      - Verify audio levels
      - Confirm all required elements present
      - Get final approval
    outputs:
      - "Approved final cut"
    duration: "30 min"

  - step: 10
    name: "Export & Delivery"
    agent: "post-supervisor"
    action: |
      Create deliverables:
      - Export final master (highest quality)
      - Export delivery formats (per specs)
      - Generate proxy/screener (if needed)
      - Create thumbnail/poster frame (if needed)
      - Verify all exports play correctly

    common_delivery_formats:

    duration: "30 min - 1 hour"

  - step: 11
    name: "Archive Project"
    agent: "post-supervisor"

      Archive for future reference:
      - Backup final project file
      - Backup final exports
      - Organize all assets
      - Document project details
      - Store in accessible location
    outputs:

    duration: "30 min"

  - step: 12
    name: "Update Context & Wrap"
    agent: "bmad-film-master"
    action: |
      Update film-project-context.md:
      - Mark post-production complete
      - Document final runtime and specs
      - Log lessons learned
      - Archive project details

      Mark project COMPLETE

  - "Hit exact target runtime"
  - "Audio is clear and well-mixed"
  - "Color is consistent and supports mood"

failure_modes:
  - issue: "Missing coverage for key moment"
    resolution: "Editor finds creative workaround (cutaway, B-roll, creative transition)"

  - issue: "Audio quality poor"
    resolution: "Use EQ/noise reduction, or suggest ADR if critical"

  - issue: "Shots don't match (color/exposure)"
    resolution: "Color correction to match, may require more aggressive grading"

  - issue: "Pacing feels off"
    resolution: "Re-cut for tighter pacing, adjust music, try different shot order"

  - issue: "Over length (e.g., 33 sec instead of 30 sec)"
    resolution: "Identify and trim non-essential moments, tighten transitions"

editing_tips:
  - "Kill your darlings—if a shot doesn't serve story, cut it"
  - "Watch with fresh eyes—take breaks between editing sessions"
  - "Audio drives emotion—music and sound design are critical"
  - "Transitions should be invisible unless motivate by style"
  - "When in doubt, cut tighter—pacing usually too slow, not too fast"
  - "Export multiple times—always test exports before delivery"
