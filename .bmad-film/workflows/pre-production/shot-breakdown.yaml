    name: "Read Context (CRITICAL FOR CONSISTENCY)"
    agent: shot-breakdown-specialist
    action: |
      **CRITICAL: Read ALL previous workflow outputs FIRST:**

      **MUST READ** (from previous workflows):
      1. `project/{project_name}/genre-analysis.md`
      2. `project/{project_name}/beat-sheet.md`
      3. `project/{project_name}/character-bible.md` (or dialect folders: `hindi/`, `tamil/`, etc.)
      4. `project/{project_name}/screenplay.md` (or dialect folders: `hindi/screenplay.md`, `tamil/screenplay.md`, etc.)

      **Extract for shooting script:**

      **From Genre Analysis**:
      - Genre type (Thriller/Romance/Horror/Comedy/Action)
      - Visual language recommendations (cinematography style)
      - Genre specialist techniques to apply

      **From Beat Sheet**:
      - Emotional progression map (where intensity peaks/dips)
      - Pacing rhythm (fast/measured/slow sections)
      - Key story beats (ensure visual coverage)

      **From Character Bible**:
      - Character emotional beats (what close-ups needed)
      - Key relationships (blocking, framing dynamics)
      - Character arcs (visual progression)

      **From Screenplay** (PRIMARY SOURCE):
      - **Scene-by-scene breakdown** (EXACT scenes to shoot)
      - Dialogue and action (EXACT what happens)
      - Story structure (pacing, rhythm)
      - Scene locations (INT/EXT, specific places)
      - Scene times (day/night, specific timing)

      **NOTE**: If multi-dialect, read ONE screenplay version for scene structure (all have same scenes).
      Dialect-specific notes added separately in production notes appendix.

      **CONSISTENCY CHECK**:
      - Shooting script scenes MUST match screenplay scenes (same events, same dialogue, same order)
      - Shooting script pacing MUST match beat-sheet rhythm
      - Visual intensity MUST match beat-sheet emotional mapping
      - Visual style MUST align with genre-analysis recommendations
      - Shot choices MUST serve character arcs from character-bible
      - Every screenplay scene gets shot breakdown (no scenes skipped)

      **Combine previous outputs with Q1-Q15 visual answers to create shooting script.**

      Understand the story, characters, and genre DEEPLY before planning shots.

  - step: 7
    name: "Shot Selection (Based on Q1-Q7 Answers)"
    agent: shot-breakdown-specialist
    action: |
      For each moment in screenplay, choose shots **using Q1-Q7 answers**:

      **Shot Size Selection** (from Q3):
      - If Q3 = "WIDE" → Emphasize: Establish location, geography, multiple characters
      - If Q3 = "TIGHT" → Emphasize: Close-ups for emotion, reaction, lies, secrets
      - If Q3 = "BALANCED" → Mix: Wide for establishing, medium for dialogue, close for emotion
      - If Q3 = "GENRE-APPROPRIATE" → Follow genre conventions

      **Angle Selection** (from Q5):
      - Use angles mentioned in Q5 answer
      - EYE LEVEL: Neutral, objective
      - HIGH ANGLE: Vulnerability, weakness (if Q5 mentioned)

      - If Q2 = "HANDHELD" → Shaky, intimate, documentary feel
      - If Q2 = "MIXED" → Static for drama, handheld for action/emotion
      - If Q2 = "DYNAMIC" → Constant movement, Scorsese-style

      **Lighting** (from Q1, Q4):
      - Apply Q1 tone (bright/balanced/dark) and Q4 mood (natural/dramatic/noir)

      **Signature Shots** (from Q7):
      - Incorporate must-have shots from Q7 at appropriate story moments

      Choose based on:
      - User's Q1-Q7 answers (PRIMARY)
      - Genre conventions (SECONDARY)
      - Story purpose
      - Emotional beat
      - Coverage needs

  - step: 8
    name: "Coverage Strategy (Based on Q8-Q11 Answers)"
    agent: shot-breakdown-specialist
    action: |
      Ensure adequate coverage for editing **using Q8-Q11 answers**:

      **Apply Q8 (Coverage Priority)**:

      IF Q8 = "MINIMAL":
      - Master shot + 1-2 essential angles only
      - Pre-planned, lock shots, less edit options
      - Fast shooting, efficient

      IF Q8 = "MODERATE":
      - Master + key coverage (over-shoulder, reactions)
      - Balanced approach
      - Standard: 1 master + 2-3 coverage angles

      IF Q8 = "EXTENSIVE":
      - Many angles, lots of edit choices
      - Dialogue: 1 master + 5+ coverage angles
      - Action: 8+ angles
      - Safer, more editing flexibility

      IF Q8 = "SINGLE-TAKE FOCUSED":
      - Long takes, minimal cutting
      - Choreographed blocking
      - Few angles, plan movement carefully

      **Apply Q9 (Close-Up Philosophy)**:

      IF Q9 = "HEAVY":
      - Faces dominate, emotion primary
      - Close-ups in most scenes
      - TV-style coverage (lots of tight shots)

      IF Q9 = "SELECTIVE":
      - Close-ups for key moments only
      - Mostly wide/medium, close-ups for emphasis

      IF Q9 = "RARE":
      - Mostly wide/medium, space over faces
      - Close-ups reserved for critical beats

      **Apply Q10 (Establishing Shots)**:

      IF Q10 = "DETAILED":
      - Long establishing shots, geography clear
      - Audience understands space fully

      IF Q10 = "QUICK":
      - Brief establish, move on
      - Efficient, get into action

      IF Q10 = "MINIMALIST":
      - Cut right into action, infer location
      - Modern, propulsive

      **Apply Q11 (Transitions)**:

      IF Q11 = "HARD CUTS":
      - Straight cuts, no transitions (90% of cuts)

      IF Q11 = "DISSOLVES":
      - Gentle fades between scenes, dreamlike, time passing

      IF Q11 = "MATCH CUTS":
      - Visual element connects scenes creatively

      IF Q11 = "CREATIVE":
      - Wipes, iris, stylized transitions

      **For Each Scene, Provide** (adjusted to Q8-Q11):

      1. **Master Shot** (Wide) - If Q8 allows
      2. **Coverage Shots** (Medium/Close) - Based on Q8, Q9
      3. **Insert Shots** (Detail) - If Q8 = moderate/extensive
      4. **Reaction Shots** - Based on Q9
      5. **Establishing Shots** - Based on Q10

      **CRITICAL**: Respect user's Q8-Q11 choices, even if less coverage than standard!

      **NOTE**: Only include dialect-specific notes if multi-dialect production.
      If single dialect, skip this section entirely.

  Shot Breakdown is STEP 5 in workflow:

  1. Story Synopsis ✅
  2. Character Bible ✅
  3. Beat Sheet ✅
  4. Screenplay ✅
  5. Shot Breakdown ⬅️ (This step)

  Shot Breakdown creates SHOOTING SCRIPT format through INTERACTIVE CO-WRITING:

  **NOT a shot list** - This is screenplay with shot descriptions embedded
  **NOT technical specs** - This is visual storytelling guide
  **NOT storyboards** - This is written visual plan
  **NOT generic patterns** - This uses YOUR 15 answers to create unique visual approach

  **IS**: Production-ready shooting script showing exactly how to film each moment

  **3-PHASE INTERACTIVE PROCESS**:
  1. Question Phase (15 questions) - Understand your visual vision
  2. Refinement Phase (optional) - Align on cinematography approach
  3. Creation Phase (shooting script) - Detailed shot-by-shot breakdown using your answers

  **WHY QUESTIONS?**
  - Every film has unique visual style (Tumbbad ≠ K3G ≠ Gangs of Wasseypur)
  - Your equipment/crew/time constraints shape realistic approach
  - Your coverage strategy (minimal vs extensive) affects shooting time
  - Decision tree uses answers to create UNIQUE shooting script, not patterns

  Format used by:
  - Bollywood directors (Anurag Kashyap, Sriram Raghavan, Karan Johar)
  - International directors (Tarantino, Nolan, Fincher)
  - Film schools (FTII, Whistling Woods)

  This is what goes on set. This is what gets filmed.

  **SHOOTING SCRIPT = SCREENPLAY + SHOT DESCRIPTIONS (based on YOUR 15 answers)**
