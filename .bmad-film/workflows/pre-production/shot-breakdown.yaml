      ```

      **Architecture visual approach internally:**

      Based on Q1-Q7 (Visual Style):
      - Determine shot language (noir vs bright, static vs dynamic)
      - Plan signature shots from Q7
      - Identify reference aesthetic from Q6

      Based on Q8-Q11 (Coverage):
      - Plan coverage depth (minimal vs extensive)
      - Determine close-up usage
      - Plan establishing shot approach
      - Choose transition style

      Based on Q12-Q15 (Production Reality):
      - Adjust shots to equipment capability
      - Scale complexity to crew size
      - Optimize for location count
      - Make shootable in time available

    name: "Read Context (CRITICAL FOR CONSISTENCY)"
    agent: shot-breakdown-specialist
    action: |
      **CRITICAL: Read ALL previous workflow outputs FIRST:**

      **MUST READ** (from previous workflows):
      1. `project/{project_name}/genre-analysis.md`
      2. `project/{project_name}/beat-sheet.md`
      3. `project/{project_name}/character-bible.md` (or dialect folders: `hindi/`, `tamil/`, etc.)
      4. `project/{project_name}/screenplay.md` (or dialect folders: `hindi/screenplay.md`, `tamil/screenplay.md`, etc.)

      **Extract for shooting script:**

      **From Genre Analysis**:
      - Genre type (Thriller/Romance/Horror/Comedy/Action)
      - Visual language recommendations (cinematography style)
      - Genre specialist techniques to apply

      **From Beat Sheet**:
      - Emotional progression map (where intensity peaks/dips)
      - Pacing rhythm (fast/measured/slow sections)
      - Key story beats (ensure visual coverage)

      **From Character Bible**:
      - Character emotional beats (what close-ups needed)
      - Key relationships (blocking, framing dynamics)
      - Character arcs (visual progression)

      **From Screenplay** (PRIMARY SOURCE):
      - **Scene-by-scene breakdown** (EXACT scenes to shoot)
      - Dialogue and action (EXACT what happens)
      - Story structure (pacing, rhythm)
      - Scene locations (INT/EXT, specific places)
      - Scene times (day/night, specific timing)

      **NOTE**: If multi-dialect, read ONE screenplay version for scene structure (all have same scenes).
      Dialect-specific notes added separately in production notes appendix.

      **CONSISTENCY CHECK**:
      - Shooting script scenes MUST match screenplay scenes (same events, same dialogue, same order)
      - Shooting script pacing MUST match beat-sheet rhythm
      - Visual intensity MUST match beat-sheet emotional mapping
      - Visual style MUST align with genre-analysis recommendations
      - Shot choices MUST serve character arcs from character-bible
      - Every screenplay scene gets shot breakdown (no scenes skipped)

    action: |
      For each moment in screenplay, choose shots **using Q1-Q7 answers**:

      **Shot Size Selection** (from Q3):
      - If Q3 = "WIDE" → Emphasize: Establish location, geography, multiple characters
      - If Q3 = "TIGHT" → Emphasize: Close-ups for emotion, reaction, lies, secrets
      - If Q3 = "BALANCED" → Mix: Wide for establishing, medium for dialogue, close for emotion
      - If Q3 = "GENRE-APPROPRIATE" → Follow genre conventions

      **Angle Selection** (from Q5):
      - Use angles mentioned in Q5 answer
      - EYE LEVEL: Neutral, objective
      - HIGH ANGLE: Vulnerability, weakness (if Q5 mentioned)

      - OVERHEAD: God's eye, patterns (if Q5 mentioned)

      **Movement Selection** (from Q2):
      - If Q2 = "STATIC" → Locked-off shots, stability, tension building
      - If Q2 = "SMOOTH" → Dolly in/out, tracking, crane shots, cinematic glides
      - If Q2 = "HANDHELD" → Shaky, intimate, documentary feel
      - If Q2 = "MIXED" → Static for drama, handheld for action/emotion
      - If Q2 = "DYNAMIC" → Constant movement, Scorsese-style

      **Lighting** (from Q1, Q4):
      - Apply Q1 tone (bright/balanced/dark) and Q4 mood (natural/dramatic/noir)

      **Signature Shots** (from Q7):
      - Incorporate must-have shots from Q7 at appropriate story moments

      Choose based on:
      - User's Q1-Q7 answers (PRIMARY)
      - Genre conventions (SECONDARY)
      - Story purpose
      - Emotional beat
      - Coverage needs

    name: "Coverage Strategy (Based on Q8-Q11 Answers)"
    agent: shot-breakdown-specialist
    action: |
      Ensure adequate coverage for editing **using Q8-Q11 answers**:

      **Apply Q8 (Coverage Priority)**:

      IF Q8 = "MINIMAL":
      - Master shot + 1-2 essential angles only
      - Pre-planned, lock shots, less edit options
      - Fast shooting, efficient

      IF Q8 = "MODERATE":
      - Master + key coverage (over-shoulder, reactions)
      - Balanced approach
      - Standard: 1 master + 2-3 coverage angles

      IF Q8 = "EXTENSIVE":
      - Many angles, lots of edit choices
      - Dialogue: 1 master + 5+ coverage angles
      - Action: 8+ angles
      - Safer, more editing flexibility

      IF Q8 = "SINGLE-TAKE FOCUSED":
      - Long takes, minimal cutting
      - Choreographed blocking
      - Few angles, plan movement carefully

      **Apply Q9 (Close-Up Philosophy)**:

      IF Q9 = "HEAVY":
      - Faces dominate, emotion primary
      - Close-ups in most scenes
      - TV-style coverage (lots of tight shots)

      IF Q9 = "SELECTIVE":
      - Close-ups for key moments only
      - Mostly wide/medium, close-ups for emphasis

      IF Q9 = "RARE":
      - Mostly wide/medium, space over faces
      - Close-ups reserved for critical beats

      **Apply Q10 (Establishing Shots)**:

      IF Q10 = "DETAILED":
      - Long establishing shots, geography clear
      - Audience understands space fully

      IF Q10 = "QUICK":
      - Brief establish, move on
      - Efficient, get into action

      IF Q10 = "MINIMALIST":
      - Cut right into action, infer location
      - Modern, propulsive

      **Apply Q11 (Transitions)**:

      IF Q11 = "HARD CUTS":
      - Straight cuts, no transitions (90% of cuts)

      IF Q11 = "DISSOLVES":
      - Gentle fades between scenes, dreamlike, time passing

      IF Q11 = "MATCH CUTS":
      - Visual element connects scenes creatively

      IF Q11 = "CREATIVE":
      - Wipes, iris, stylized transitions

      **For Each Scene, Provide** (adjusted to Q8-Q11):

      1. **Master Shot** (Wide) - If Q8 allows
      2. **Coverage Shots** (Medium/Close) - Based on Q8, Q9
      3. **Insert Shots** (Detail) - If Q8 = moderate/extensive
      4. **Reaction Shots** - Based on Q9
      5. **Establishing Shots** - Based on Q10

      **CRITICAL**: Respect user's Q8-Q11 choices, even if less coverage than standard!

      ```
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      ## DIALECT-SPECIFIC PRODUCTION NOTES
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

      **MULTI-DIALECT PRODUCTION DETECTED**

      ---

      ### SCENE 1 - COMMUNITY HALL CELEBRATION

      **UNIVERSAL VISUAL** (same for all dialects):
      - Camera: Wide shot, high angle
      - Lighting: Warm practical lights
      - Blocking: Characters arranged in semicircle

      **DIALECT-SPECIFIC NOTES**:

      **HINDI VERSION**:
      - Decor: Marigold garlands, "Shubh Vivah" banner (Devanagari)
      - Costumes: Salwar kameez (Meera), jeans+tee (Arjun)
      - Props: None specific

      ### COSTUME REFERENCE CHART

      | Character | Hindi | Tamil | Telugu |
      |-----------|-------|-------|--------|
      | Meera     | Salwar kameez | Half-saree/Churidar | Pattu langa option |
      | Arjun     | Jeans+tee | Same OR lungi-shirt | Same |
      | Elders    | Traditional | Dhoti+angavastram | Traditional Telugu |

      **AI Shot Breakdown Specialist asks 5 AI platform questions:**

      Reference: `.bmad-film/agents/ai-shot-breakdown-specialist.md`

      **Q16. AI Video Platform**:
      AI video generation ke liye kaun sa platform use karoge?
      Naam batao — jaise Veo3, Runway, Pika, Kling.
      DEFAULT: Veo3

      **Q17. AI Image Generation (for stills/reference)**:
      Character aur location reference images ke liye kaun sa tool?
      Naam batao — jaise Midjourney, Flux, Firefly.
      DEFAULT: Midjourney

      **Q18. Shot Duration per Clip**:
      Har AI clip ki duration kitni ho?
      Seconds mein batao — jaise 5 sec, 8 sec, 10 sec.
      DEFAULT: 5-8 sec (scene ke hisaab se)

      **Q19. Character Consistency Strategy**:
      Characters ko consistent rakhne ka method kya ho?
      Batao apna approach.
      DEFAULT: Descriptive anchors — har prompt mein same character
               description word-for-word copy karo

      **Q20. Visual Style**:
      AI generation ka visual style kya ho?
      Batao — jaise ultra-realistic, film grain, documentary.
      DEFAULT: Ultra-realistic live action

      **Collect ALL 5 answers before proceeding.**
      DEFAULT if skipped: Veo3 + Midjourney + 5-8 sec + descriptive anchors + ultra-realistic.

    name: "AI Shot Architecture + Character Anchors"
    agent: ai-shot-breakdown-specialist
    action: |
      **Build AI generation architecture from all answers:**

      **From Q16-Q20 (AI Platform Setup)**:
      - Primary platform + secondary platform determined
      - AI INSTRUCTIONS template format locked (Veo3/Nano Banana/Runway/Pika)
      - Aspect ratio from Q17
      - Duration strategy from Q18
      - Consistency method from Q19
      - Color/tone rule from Q20

      **From Q1-Q7 (Traditional Visual Style)**:
      - Visual tone → COLOR & TONE RULE per shot
      - Camera movement → CAMERA MOVEMENT per shot
      - Shot sizes → SHOT TYPE / SCALE guidance
      - Lighting mood → LIGHTING per shot
      - Reference films → AI aesthetic guidance

      **Build CHARACTER ANCHORS**:
      For each recurring character, create anchor description:
      ```
      CHARACTER ANCHOR — [Name]:
      Age: [specific range]
      Build: [precise physical]
      Face: [specific features]
      Skin: [tone + texture]
      Key marker: [ONE distinctive anchor feature]
      Key clothing: [exact clothing with colors, if consistent across scenes]
      ```

      **CHARACTER CONSISTENCY RULES (ABSOLUTE — NEVER BREAK)**:
      1. Build anchor from character-bible.md — exact physical details only
      2. Write ALL anchors at FILE TOP before any shots begin
      3. EVERY AI INSTRUCTIONS field for that character = word-for-word copy of anchor
      4. ZERO variation between shots — same character = same anchor text, always
      5. Anchor text is LOCKED — never edit after writing, not even one word
      6. If character changes clothes between scenes, create separate anchor per costume
      7. NEVER paraphrase anchor — copy exactly, never summarize or rephrase

      This anchor text used IDENTICALLY in every AI INSTRUCTIONS entry for that character.

      **Synthesize and announce**:
      ```
      AI generation setup clear hai:

      ✓ Platform: [Q16 answer]
      ✓ Image tool: [Q17 answer]
      ✓ Duration: [Q18 answer]
      ✓ Consistency: [Q19 method]
      ✓ Style: [Q20 — default/override]

      Character anchors created for: [character names]

      Ab AI shot entries generate karta hoon — 18 fields har shot ke liye.
      Yeh paste-ready prompts honge.
      ```

    name: "Generate AI Shot Breakdown (18 Fields Per Shot)"
    agent: ai-shot-breakdown-specialist
    action: |
      **Generate shot-breakdown-ai.md using ALL screenplay scenes:**

      **CRITICAL: Read screenplay carefully. Every scene gets AI shot entries.**
      **CRITICAL: Use character anchors IDENTICALLY in every AI INSTRUCTIONS for that character.**
      **CRITICAL: AI INSTRUCTIONS must be platform-specific and paste-ready.**

      **MULTI-FILE SPLIT RULE — MANDATORY:**
      IF total shots > 20: ALWAYS split into multiple part files. NEVER write all shots in one file.
      Split logic:
      - Max 10-15 shots per part file — split by SCENE GROUPS (never mid-scene)
      - Name convention: shot-breakdown-ai-part1.md, shot-breakdown-ai-part2.md, etc.
      - EVERY part file includes FULL Global Character Anchors at top — each part is self-contained
      - Continue shot numbering sequentially across parts (001 onward — NEVER restart numbering)
      - Each part file header: "PART N of TOTAL | scene coverage | shot range"
      - End of each part (except last): note → "Continue: shot-breakdown-ai-partN+1.md → Scene X (Shots YYY–ZZZ)"
      - WHY SPLIT: Claude output token limit ~32,000. 47 shots × 18 fields × ~200 words = exceeds limit.
        Splitting ensures EVERY shot gets complete 18-field treatment — no shortcuts, no truncation.

      STANDARD SPLIT for 5-minute micro film (~47 shots):
        PART 1 → Scenes 1-2  (Shots 001-015, ~15 shots)
        PART 2 → Scenes 3-4  (Shots 016-027, ~12 shots)
        PART 3 → Scene 5     (Shots 028-041, ~14 shots — Climax)
        PART 4 → Scenes 6-7  (Shots 042-047, ~6 shots — Resolution)

      For shorter films (≤ 20 shots total): single file shot-breakdown-ai.md is acceptable.

      **MANDATORY RULES — NEVER BREAK (applies to every single field):**
      1. NO "/" IN ANY FIELD — one definitive value only, always.
         WRONG: "Wide / Establishing"         CORRECT: "Wide — Establishing Shot"
         WRONG: "pan left / static"            CORRECT: "pan left — 2 seconds, slow"
         WRONG: "morning / afternoon"          CORRECT: "morning, 9 AM"
      2. NO "or" IN ANY FIELD — state what IS, not what could be.
         WRONG: "one or two tears"             CORRECT: "two tears on face, unwiped"
         WRONG: "sits or stands"               CORRECT: "sits on floor, both legs folded"
         WRONG: "back of head or shoulder"     CORRECT: "back of head, right side"
      3. NO conditional language anywhere — "unless specified", "if applicable",
         "might be", "could be", "possibly", "either", "depending on"
      4. NO alternatives or options — every field = one definitive, final answer
      5. CHARACTER ANCHOR in AI INSTRUCTIONS = word-for-word copy from GLOBAL CHARACTER ANCHORS.
         Never paraphrase. Never summarize. Never rephrase. Copy exactly.
      6. SHOT TYPE field = exactly ONE type. CAMERA MOVEMENT field = exactly ONE movement.

      **For EACH scene, for EACH shot, fill ALL 18 fields:**

      1. SHOT NO.: Sequential (001, 002, 003...)
      2. SHOT TYPE / SCALE: From visual analysis + Q3 answer
      3. LOCATION: City + area + specific place + in/outdoor + era
      4. TIME & DAY: Exact time + year/period
      5. ENVIRONMENT & SET DETAIL: Hyper-specific — walls, floor, weather, textures, objects, cultural elements
      6. CHARACTERS IN FRAME: Who + count + position + distance + key appearance
      7. CHARACTER ACTION: Micro-action level — step-by-step what happens in the clip
      8. FACIAL EXPRESSION & BODY LANGUAGE: Anatomically specific — jaw, eyes, posture, hands, breath
      9. DIALOGUE (IF ANY): Devanagari for Hindi dialogue | Roman for English | "Koi dialogue nahi" if absent
      10. CORE VOICE TONE (IF DIALOGUE): Accent + pitch + emotion + pacing | "Dialogue nahi hai" if absent
      11. CAMERA MOVEMENT: Static / Pan direction + speed / Dolly in/out / Handheld intensity
      12. CAMERA SPECS: Lens mm equivalent + aperture feel + DOF + grain if relevant
      13. LIGHTING: Natural source + direction + quality (hard/soft) + time accuracy + color temp
      14. COLOR & TONE RULE: Default = raw neutral no-grading + any scene-specific exception
      15. AUDIO / SFX: Layered ambient — 3-4 specific sounds + silence note if intentional
      16. MOOD & SUBTEXT: Emotional undertone in Hindi + narrative purpose
      17. REALISM CONSTRAINTS: Explicit "no" list — no lens flare, no VFX, no beautification, no color grading
      18. AI INSTRUCTIONS: Platform-specific paste-ready English prompt with character anchor + negatives

  Shot Breakdown is STEP 5 in workflow:

  1. Story Synopsis ✅
  2. Character Bible ✅
  3. Beat Sheet ✅
  4. Screenplay ✅
  5. Shot Breakdown ⬅️ (This step)

  Shot Breakdown produces TWO DOCUMENTS in one workflow:

  ── DOCUMENT 1: shot-breakdown.md (Traditional / Offline Filmmaking) ──────────
  **NOT a shot list** - This is screenplay with shot descriptions embedded
  **NOT technical specs** - This is visual storytelling guide
  **NOT storyboards** - This is written visual plan
  **IS**: Production-ready shooting script for directors, DPs, ADs, script supervisors

  Format used by:
  - Bollywood directors (Anurag Kashyap, Sriram Raghavan, Karan Johar)
  - International directors (Tarantino, Nolan, Fincher)
  - Film schools (FTII, Whistling Woods)

  ── DOCUMENT 2: shot-breakdown-ai.md (AI Filmmaking) ────────────────────────
  **IS**: 18-field per-shot entries optimized for AI video/image generation
  **Platform support**: Veo3, Nano Banana, Runway Gen-4, Pika 2.2, Midjourney v6
  **Each entry contains**:
    - Hyper-detailed environment + set description
    - Micro-action character behavior
    - Anatomically specific facial/body language
    - Dialogue in Devanagari (for lip-sync accuracy)
    - Platform-specific paste-ready AI INSTRUCTIONS
    - Explicit realism constraints (no VFX, no color grading, no beautification)
    - Layered audio/SFX descriptions
    - Character anchor descriptions for consistency

  **WHY 5 EXTRA QUESTIONS (Q16-Q20)?**
  - AI tools need platform-specific prompt formats
  - Character consistency requires different strategies per tool
  - Shot duration varies by platform capability
  - Aspect ratio is a generation-time decision (not post-production)

  **4-PHASE INTERACTIVE PROCESS**:
  1. Traditional Questions (Q1-Q15) — Visual vision + production reality
  2. AI Platform Questions (Q16-Q20) — Platform, ratio, duration, consistency
  3. Traditional Shot Breakdown — Shooting script for set use
  4. AI Shot Breakdown — 18-field entries, paste-ready prompts

  **SHOOTING SCRIPT = SCREENPLAY + SHOT DESCRIPTIONS (Q1-Q15 answers)**
  **AI BREAKDOWN = SCREENPLAY + HYPER-DETAIL + PLATFORM PROMPTS (Q16-Q20 answers)**
