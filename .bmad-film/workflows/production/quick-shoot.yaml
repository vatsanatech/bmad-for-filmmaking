  - "script-supervisor"
  - "producer"
  - "directors-assistant"

    - "creative_vision" # Visual style, tone, story beats
    - "available_resources" # Crew, equipment, location
    - "shoot_date" # When production happens

  optional:
    - "shot_list" # If pre-planned
    - "location_details"
    - "talent_info" # If actors involved

process:
  - step: 1
    name: "Production Planning"
    agent: "first-ad"
    collaborators: ["producer", "cinematographer"]
    action: |
      Create streamlined production plan:
      - Confirm shoot date, time, location
      - Verify crew and equipment availability
      - Create simple call sheet (who, when, where)
      - Identify potential issues and backup plans
    outputs:
      - "Simple call sheet"
      - "Equipment checklist"
      - "Backup plan if needed"
    duration: "30 min"

  - step: 2
    name: "Shot List Creation"
    agent: "directors-assistant"
    collaborators: ["cinematographer"]
    action: |
      Build efficient shot list:
      - Translate story beats into specific shots (3-7 shots typical for 30 sec)
      - Define camera angles, lenses, movement
      - Prioritize: Essential shots vs. nice-to-have
      - Estimate time per shot

      For 30-second project typical shots:
      1. Establishing/Wide (set context)
      2. Medium shot (main action)
      3. Close-up (emotional beat or product)
      4. Insert/Detail (key object or moment)
      5. Optional: B-roll for coverage
    outputs:
      - "Shot list with priorities"
      - "Time estimates per shot"
      - "Technical notes (lens, camera, lighting)"
    duration: "30 min"

  - step: 3
    name: "Technical Preparation"
    agent: "cinematographer"
    action: |
      Prepare technical execution plan:
      - Camera package (body, lenses, support)
      - Lighting approach (natural light + minimal artificial)
      - Setup sequence (most efficient order)
      - Backup equipment plan
    outputs:
      - "Camera/lighting package list"
      - "Setup sequence"
    duration: "20 min"

  - step: 4
    name: "Pre-Shoot Briefing"
    agent: "first-ad"
    action: |
      Brief all participants:
      - Review creative vision and story beats
      - Walk through shot list
      - Confirm timing and schedule
      - Clarify roles and responsibilities
      - Safety briefing if needed
    duration: "15 min (on shoot day)"

  - step: 5
    name: "Production Execution"
    agent: "first-ad"
    collaborators: ["cinematographer", "script-supervisor", "directors-assistant"]
    action: |
      Execute shoot day:

      1. Setup (Cinematographer leads)
         - Equipment setup
         - Lighting setup
         - Camera tests

      2. Shooting (1st AD manages flow)
         - Work through shot list in order
         - Monitor time vs. schedule
         - Ensure adequate takes per shot
         - Script Supervisor tracks continuity
         - Directors Assistant ensures creative vision maintained

      3. Coverage Verification (Script Supervisor)
         - Check all essential shots captured
         - Flag any missing elements
         - Confirm adequate takes exist

      4. Wrap
         - Equipment breakdown
         - Data backup
         - Location restoration
    outputs:
      - "Raw footage (backed up)"
      - "Continuity notes"
      - "Production report"
    duration: "Variable (2-6 hours typical for micro project)"

  - step: 6
    name: "Post-Shoot Wrap"
    agent: "first-ad"
    action: |
      End-of-day wrap activities:
      - Verify all footage backed up (dual backups minimum)
      - Generate production report
      - Update film-project-context.md
      - Flag any issues for post-production
      - Prepare handoff to Editor
    outputs:
      - "Production report"
      - "Footage organized and backed up"
      - "Notes for Editor"
    duration: "30 min"

  - step: 7
    name: "Update Context & Next Steps"
    agent: "bmad-film-master"
    action: |
      Update film-project-context.md:
      - Mark production phase complete
      - Log production details
      - Document any issues or changes
      - Update continuity registry

      Recommend next workflow: /quick-edit
    duration: "10 min"

context_updates:
  - section: "current_phase"
    update: "Production complete, moving to Post-Production"

  - section: "production_notes"
    add:
      - "Shoot date and location"
      - "Crew and equipment used"
      - "Issues encountered and resolutions"
      - "Coverage assessment"

  - section: "continuity_registry"
    add: "On-set continuity notes"

success_criteria:
  - "All essential shots captured with adequate takes"
  - "Footage backed up securely (dual backups)"
  - "Continuity maintained across shots"
  - "Production stayed on schedule and budget"
  - "No safety incidents"
  - "Footage ready for editing handoff"

failure_modes:
  - issue: "Missing essential shot"
    resolution: "1st AD identifies before wrap, capture as pickup immediately"

  - issue: "Continuity break discovered"
    resolution: "Script Supervisor flags, reshoot affected shots if critical"

  - issue: "Running behind schedule"
    resolution: "1st AD prioritizes essential shots, drops nice-to-haves"

  - issue: "Equipment failure"
    resolution: "Use backup equipment or adapt creatively with available gear"

  - issue: "Location issue"
    resolution: "Activate backup location plan or adjust shooting approach"

on_set_decision_framework: |
  WHEN running short on time:
  1. Refer to shot list priorities (Essential vs. nice-to-have)
  2. Capture essential shots FIRST
  3. Add coverage only if time permits

  WHEN technical issue arises:
  1. Assess: Can we fix quickly (< 10 min) or need workaround?
  2. If quick fix: Do it
  3. If requires time: Find creative workaround or adjust approach

  WHEN creative change proposed on set:
  1. Assess time impact
  2. If improves story and fits schedule: Do it
  3. If adds time: Only if essential AND can cut something else

next_workflows:
  - "/quick-edit" # Move to post-production

tips:
  - "Setup time is longer than you think—first shot always takes longest"
  - "Get the master shot first (widest shot establishing scene)"
  - "Adequate takes > perfect single take (give Editor options)"
  - "Simple lighting fast, fast shoots allow more takes"
  - "Backup footage immediately—never delete from camera until confirmed backed up twice"
