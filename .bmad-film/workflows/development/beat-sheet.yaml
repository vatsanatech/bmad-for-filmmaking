  **INTERACTIVE CO-WRITING** - Creates story beat sheet through questions, breaking story into key emotional/plot moments.

  **WHAT IS BEAT SHEET?**
  A beat sheet is the bridge between story synopsis and screenplay. It breaks the story into individual "beats" (moments/units of action) showing:
  - Story progression beat-by-beat
  - Emotional arcs mapped
  - Key turning points identified
  - Pacing and rhythm defined

  **WHY BEAT SHEET?**
  - Ensures screenplay covers all essential story beats
  - Maps emotional highs/lows before writing dialogue
  - Identifies pacing issues early
  - Industry-standard tool (used by Save the Cat, Blake Snyder, Syd Field methods)

  **3-PHASE PROCESS**:

  **Phase 1: Beat Questions (8 questions)**
  - Story Developer asks about story structure and pacing
  - Identifies key emotional beats
  - Understands YOUR vision for story rhythm

  **Phase 2: Beat Analysis**
  - Analyzes story synopsis for natural beats
  - Maps emotional progression
  - Identifies turning points

  **Phase 3: Beat Sheet Creation**
  - Creates detailed beat-by-beat breakdown
  - Numbers each beat with description
  - Shows emotional tone per beat
  - **Universal for all dialects** (story structure doesn't change)

  Creates UNIQUE beat sheet based on your story + answers.

  This runs AFTER character-bible, BEFORE screenplay.

  Input: Story synopsis + Character bible
  Output: Beat sheet document (universal - same for all dialects)

    name: "Read Project Context (CRITICAL FOR CONSISTENCY)"
    agent: story-developer

    action: |
      **CRITICAL: Read ALL previous workflow outputs FIRST:**

      **MUST READ** (from previous workflows):
      1. `project/{project_name}/genre-analysis.md` - Genre, tone, pacing recommendations
      2. `project/{project_name}/story-synopsis.md` - **BOTH versions** (continuous narrative + scene-by-scene)
      3. `project/{project_name}/character-bible.md` - Character arcs and transformations
         - OR if multi-dialect: `project/{project_name}/{dialect}/character-bible.md` (read all dialects to understand arc)

      **Extract for beat sheet:**
      - Genre and expected pacing rhythm → FROM genre-analysis
      - All story events in order → FROM story-synopsis (scene-by-scene version)
      - Character emotional arcs → FROM character-bible
      - Key story turning points → FROM story-synopsis
      - Character transformations → FROM character-bible

      **CONSISTENCY CHECK**:
      - Beat sheet MUST cover all story events from synopsis (no events skipped)
      - Beat sheet MUST align with character arcs from character-bible
      - Beat sheet MUST follow genre pacing from genre-analysis

      **Combine previous outputs to create beat sheet foundation.**

    outputs:
      - Story understanding complete
      - Character arcs identified
      - Genre pacing understood

  - step: 2
    name: "PHASE 1 - Beat Sheet Questions (8 questions)"
    agent: story-developer

    action: |
      **Story Developer asks 8 beat sheet questions:**

      **A. STRUCTURE APPROACH (3 questions)**:

      Q1. Story Structure Type - Kaun sa structure best fit hai?
         OPTIONS:
         - THREE-ACT (Setup → Confrontation → Resolution)
         - FIVE-ACT (Exposition → Rising → Climax → Falling → Resolution)
         - NON-LINEAR (Flashbacks, time jumps, puzzle)
         - CIRCULAR (Ends where it began)
         - SINGLE TIMELINE (Simple A→B→C progression)

      Q2. Opening Hook Strategy - Story kaise shuru honi chahiye?
         OPTIONS:
         - IN MEDIAS RES (Action mein directly)
         - SLOW BURN (Establish world first)
         - MYSTERY OPENING (Question raise karo)
         - CHARACTER INTRO (Character se shuru)
         - WORLD BUILDING (Setting establish first)

      Q3. Pacing Rhythm - Overall pacing kaisi chahiye?
         OPTIONS:
         - FAST-PACED (Quick beats, rapid progression)
         - MEASURED (Balanced, breathing room)
         - SLOW BURN (Gradual build, patience)
         - UNEVEN (Varies - slow then fast)
         - RELENTLESS (Non-stop, no breaks)

      **B. EMOTIONAL BEATS (3 questions)**:

      Q4. Emotional Highs - Kahaan audience ko high/excited feel hona chahiye? (List 2-3 moments)
         Example: "When protagonist succeeds", "Romantic confession", "Victory moment"

      Q5. Emotional Lows - Kahaan audience ko low/tense feel hona chahiye? (List 2-3 moments)
         Example: "When protagonist fails", "Betrayal reveal", "All seems lost"

      Q6. Climax Emotional Peak - Climax mein audience ko kya feel karna chahiye?
         OPTIONS:
         - TRIUMPH/VICTORY (Hero wins!)
         - TRAGEDY/LOSS (Hero loses)
         - BITTERSWEET (Win but at cost)
         - SHOCK/SURPRISE (Unexpected twist)
         - CATHARSIS (Emotional release)
         - AMBIGUOUS (Uncertain/open)

      **C. BEAT DETAIL LEVEL (2 questions)**:

      Q7. Beat Granularity - Beats kitne detailed chahiye?
         OPTIONS:
         - MACRO BEATS (10-15 big beats, major moments only)
         - MODERATE (20-30 beats, scene-level detail)
         - MICRO BEATS (40+ beats, every story unit)
         - MINIMAL (5-8 beats, sequences only)

      Q8. Scene Transition Notes - Beats mein transitions ka mention?
         OPTIONS:
         - YES (How beats connect, transition notes)
         - NO (Just beat description, no transition)
         - SELECTIVE (Only for complex transitions)

      **Collect ALL 8 answers before proceeding.**

    duration: "10-15 min"

  - step: 3
    name: "Answer Synthesis & Beat Architecture"
    agent: story-developer

    action: |
      **Synthesize ALL 8 answers and plan beat structure:**

      ```
      Perfect! Beat sheet vision clear hai:

      ✓ Structure: [Q1 answer - three-act/non-linear/etc.]
      ✓ Opening: [Q2 answer - in medias res/slow burn]
      ✓ Pacing: [Q3 answer - fast/measured/slow burn]
      ✓ Emotional Highs: [Q4 answer - specific moments]
      ✓ Emotional Lows: [Q5 answer - specific moments]
      ✓ Climax Feel: [Q6 answer - triumph/tragedy/etc.]
      ✓ Detail Level: [Q7 answer - macro/moderate/micro]
      ✓ Transitions: [Q8 answer - yes/no/selective]

      Yeh sahi hai? Final confirm before beat sheet creation?
      ```

      **Apply Decision Tree**:

      Based on answers, determine:
      - Beat count (Q7 - macro=10-15, moderate=20-30, micro=40+)
      - Structure type (Q1 - three-act divisions, non-linear markers)
      - Opening approach (Q2 - cold open vs slow intro)
      - Pacing distribution (Q3 - fast=quick beats, slow=longer beats)
      - Emotional beat placement (Q4, Q5 - where highs/lows go)
      - Climax construction (Q6 - how to build to peak)
      - Transition notes inclusion (Q8 - add or skip)

    name: "PHASE 2 - Extract Beats from Story Synopsis"
    agent: story-developer
    collaboration:
      - genre-specific-agent

    action: |
      **Extract natural story beats from story synopsis:**

      Read scene-by-scene version from story-synopsis.md:
      - Identify each distinct story unit/moment
      - Each scene may have 1-3 beats
      - Beat = Unit of action/emotion (not necessarily full scene)

      **For each beat, identify**:
      - What happens (action/event)
      - Who's involved (characters)
      - Emotional tone (happy/tense/sad/shocking)
      - Story function (setup/complication/revelation/resolution)
      - Character arc progression (how character changes)

      **Count beats based on Q7 answer**:
      - If Q7 = MACRO → Combine multiple moments into big beats (10-15 total)
      - If Q7 = MODERATE → Scene-level beats (20-30 total)
      - If Q7 = MICRO → Every action/emotion shift (40+ total)
      - If Q7 = MINIMAL → Major sequences only (5-8 total)

    outputs:
      - Raw beat list extracted from story
      - Emotional tone per beat
      - Story function per beat

  - step: 5
    name: "Map Emotional Progression (Using Q4-Q6 Answers)"
    agent: story-developer

    action: |
      **Map emotional journey using Q4-Q6 answers:**

      Create emotional arc graph (conceptual):

      ```
      EMOTIONAL INTENSITY

      HIGH  |     [Q4 HIGH]      [CLIMAX-Q6]
            |    /            /\
      MID   |   /   [Q4]    /  \
            |  /           /    \
      LOW   | /  [Q5 LOW] /  [Q5]
            |________________TIME→
           Start          Mid          End
      ```

      **Place Q4 emotional highs** at appropriate story beats:
      - User specified 2-3 high moments in Q4
      - Find beats matching those descriptions
      - Mark as EMOTIONAL HIGH

      **Place Q5 emotional lows** at appropriate story beats:
      - User specified 2-3 low moments in Q5
      - Find beats matching those descriptions
      - Mark as EMOTIONAL LOW

      **Build to Q6 climax emotion**:
      - Q6 specified climax feeling (triumph/tragedy/etc.)
      - Ensure beats build toward that emotion
      - Climax beat reflects Q6 choice

      **Apply Q3 pacing**:
      - If FAST-PACED → Beats quick, rapid progression, less breathing room
      - If MEASURED → Beats balanced, even distribution, some pauses
      - If SLOW BURN → Beats gradual, patient build, more setup
      - If UNEVEN → Vary beat length/intensity (slow → fast → slow)
      - If RELENTLESS → No pause beats, constant forward drive

    outputs:
      - Emotional arc mapped
      - Highs and lows placed per Q4-Q5
      - Pacing rhythm applied per Q3
      - Climax emotion aligned with Q6

notes: |
  Beat Sheet is STEP 3 in development workflow:

  1. Story Synopsis ✅
  2. Character Bible ✅
  3. Beat Sheet ⬅️ (This step - NEW!)
  4. Screenplay (uses beat sheet for structure)

  **WHY BEAT SHEET MATTERS**:
  - Industry standard tool (Save the Cat, Blake Snyder, Syd Field)
  - Prevents screenplay structural problems
  - Maps emotional journey before dialogue writing
  - Identifies pacing issues early (easier to fix in beats than in screenplay)
  - Ensures all story events covered
  - Shows character arc progression clearly

  **Beat vs Scene**:
  - BEAT = Unit of story/emotion (may be part of scene or full scene)
  - SCENE = Location/time unit (INT. ROOM - DAY)
  - One scene may have multiple beats
  - One beat may span multiple scenes (montage)

  **Universal for Multi-Dialect**:
  - Story beats same for all languages
  - Emotional progression universal
  - Only ONE beat-sheet.md created
  - Screenplay adapts beats to dialect-specific dialogue

  Beat Sheet → Screenplay is smoother than Synopsis → Screenplay directly.

  This is the filmmaker's roadmap before writing actual scenes.
