  **INTERACTIVE CO-WRITING + MULTI-DIALECT LOCALIZATION** - Creates three-dimensional characters through questions, with optional multi-language/dialect support.

  **NEW IN v3.0**: Multi-dialect/language support for regional Indian content!
  Create same story in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, etc. with culturally-appropriate character adaptations.

  **4-PHASE PROCESS**:

  **Phase 0: Dialect & Localization Setup (NEW!)**
  - Ask: Single dialect or multi-dialect production?
  - If multi-dialect: Which languages? (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, etc.)
  - Localization depth? (Dialogue only / Dialogue+Names / Full cultural)
  - Creates separate character-bible file per dialect selected

  **Phase 1: Character Questions (18 questions)**
  - Character Developer asks about protagonist depth (8 questions)
  - Asks about supporting characters (5 questions per major character)
  - Asks about character dynamics (5 questions)
  - Understands YOUR vision for each person

  **Phase 2: Collaborative Refinement**
  - Presents initial profiles based on answers
  - You refine specific details
  - Iterates until characters feel RIGHT

  **Phase 3: Profile Creation**
  - Creates detailed character bible based on ALL answers
  - Principals get full 8-aspect profiles
  - Supporting get appropriate depth (moderate/brief)
  - **IF MULTI-DIALECT**: Creates culturally-adapted versions per language
    - Names adapted (Arjun → Arun/Arnab/Aravind)
    - Speech patterns in regional language
    - Cultural backgrounds localized
    - Regional attire/references

  Creates UNIQUE characters based on your answers, not templates.
  Supports single language (default: Hindi) OR multiple Indian languages/dialects.

  This runs AFTER story synopsis, BEFORE screenplay.

  Input: Approved story synopsis
  Output: Complete character bible(s) - single file OR multiple dialect-specific files

      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      📍 STEP 0 of 5 — Reading project files + Dialect Setup
      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      Reading: genre-analysis.md + story-synopsis.md
      ```
      **🔴 MANDATORY: Read these files BEFORE asking any questions:**
      - `project/{project_name}/genre-analysis.md`
      - `project/{project_name}/story-synopsis.md`

      **Determine language/dialect strategy before character development:**

      **DEFAULT**: Single Dialect (Simple Bollywood Hindi — 60-70% Hindi + 30-40% English). Most projects use this. Continue to Step 1.

      **IF MULTI-DIALECT NEEDED**: Specify which languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, etc.) and localization depth (dialogue only / dialogue + names / full cultural adaptation). AI creates separate character-bible files per dialect.

      **Single language or multiple? Agar single hai toh Step 1 continue karo — koi question nahi. Agar multi-dialect chahiye toh languages batao.**

    outputs:
      - Dialect strategy determined
      - File naming convention set
      - Localization depth defined

    duration: "5-10 min (only if multi-dialect chosen, otherwise quick default)"

    name: "Extract Characters from Story (Preparation)"
    agent: character-developer

    action: |
      **CRITICAL: Read approved story synopsis FIRST for consistency:**

      **MUST READ** (from previous workflow outputs):
      - `project/{project_name}/genre-analysis.md` (genre, tone, visual language)
      - `project/{project_name}/story-synopsis.md` (BOTH versions - continuous narrative + scene-by-scene)

      **Extract characters from story synopsis:**

      Create initial roster based on STORY (not assumptions):
      - Protagonist (lead, main character FROM STORY)
      - Major Supporting (2-4 key characters FROM STORY)
      - Minor Supporting (functional roles FROM STORY)

      **CONSISTENCY CHECK**: All characters MUST come from approved story.

      **NOTE**: Character names in story-synopsis may be generic/placeholder.
      These will be finalized based on dialect preferences from Step 0.

      This roster will guide which questions to ask in Step 2.

      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      ```
      **Character Developer asks 18 questions:**

      Reference: `.bmad-film/agents/character-developer.md`

      **A. PROTAGONIST DEEP DIVE (8 questions - ALWAYS)**:

      Q1. Biggest Fear - Internal dar kya hai? (Not external danger)
         Examples: Failure, abandonment, loss of control, being exposed

      Q2. Shaping Backstory - Kaunsa ek event ne shape kiya?
         ONE pivotal moment that made them who they are

      Q3. Character Flaw - Kaun sa flaw rok raha hai?
         Pride? Cowardice? Dishonesty? Cynicism? Impulsiveness?

      Q4. Speech Patterns - Woh kaise bolte hain?
         Formal? Casual? Regional? Terse? Witty? Nervous?

      Q5. Physical Description - Appearance kya hai?
         Age, build, face, clothing style, distinguishing marks

      Q6. Character Transformation - End mein kaise change hote hain?
         Internal growth, what they learn, start vs end

      Q7. Relatability Factor - Flaws ke baavjood, kyun root karega audience?
         Good intentions? Humor? Love for someone? Underdog? Vulnerability?

      **B. SUPPORTING CHARACTERS (5 questions PER major character)**:

      For EACH major supporting character identified in Step 1:

      Q9. Relationship to Protagonist - [CHARACTER X] ka protagonist se kya rishta?
         Family? Friend? Mentor? Rival? Love interest? Authority?

      Q10. What They Want - [CHARACTER X] protagonist se kya chahte hain?
         Approval? Help? Change? Revenge? Nothing? Distance?

      Q11. Help or Hinder? - [CHARACTER X] protagonist ki help ya obstacles?
         Ally? Obstacle? Complex? Catalyst? Mirror? Neutral?

      Q12. Specific Traits/Quirks - [CHARACTER X] ko memorable kya banayega?
         Specific behavior, quirk, habit (not generic "nice guy")

      Q13. Depth Level Needed - [CHARACTER X] ko kitni depth?
         Brief (1-2 scenes)? Moderate (recurring)? Full (major role)?

      **C. CHARACTER DYNAMICS (5 questions)**:

      Q14. Key Relationships - Sabse important relationships kaun se? (Top 2-3)

      Q15. Antagonist Type - Villain kaisa? Clear evil? Morally complex?
         System? Internal demons? No antagonist?

      **CHARACTER CONTRADICTION DESIGN (mandatory — ask for EVERY character):**

      *Real logon mein contradiction hoti hai. Cardboard characters mein nahi.*

      Core Contradiction Question: "[Character name] ke andar kaunsi EK badi contradiction hai?"
      → NOT: "Woh strong hai lekin weak bhi hai" (too vague)
      → YES: "Woh dost ke liye kuch bhi kar sakta hai lekin apni behen ke phone nahi uthata"

      Contradiction Types (show writer, they recognize their character):
      TYPE 1 — COURAGE + COWARDICE IN DIFFERENT DOMAINS:
        "Kahan woh bilkul nahi darti — aur kahan woh bilkul darr jaati hai?"
      TYPE 2 — GENEROUS + SELFISH IN DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS:
        "Kiske saath woh bahut deta/deti hai — aur kiske saath bilkul nahi?"
      TYPE 3 — STATED BELIEF vs ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
        "Woh kya kehta/kehti hai apne baare mein jo bilkul sach nahi hai?"
      TYPE 4 — PAST SELF vs PRESENT SELF:
        "Woh pehle kaisa tha — aur ab bilkul ulta kyun hai?"

      CONTRADICTION RULES:
      → Both sides must be VISIBLE in the story (not just backstory)
      → Must create at least ONE scene of friction with another character
      → Contradiction is NOT a flaw — it's a TRUTH. Characters face it, don't necessarily fix it.

      Add to every character profile:
      Character Contradiction: [Quality A] contradicts [Quality B] | Scene where most visible: [which scene]

      **Collect ALL answers (7 protagonist + 5xN supporting + 2 dynamics) before proceeding.**

    duration: "20-30 min"

  - step: 3
    name: "Answer Synthesis & Profile Architecture"
    agent: character-developer

    action: |
      **Synthesize ALL answers and plan character profiles:**

      ```
      Perfect! Characters clear hain:

      ✓ Protagonist: [Name, fear, flaw, transformation]
      ✓ Key Supporting: [2-3 major characters identified]
      ✓ Dynamics: [Key relationships, romance?, antagonist type]
      ✓ Depth Levels: [Who gets full/moderate/brief]

      Yeh sahi hai? Final confirm before creating profiles?
      ```

      **Apply Decision Tree**:

      Based on answers, determine:
      - Protagonist gets FULL depth (all 8 aspects)
      - Antagonist depth based on Q16 (complex = full, clear villain = moderate)
      - Love interest depth based on Q15 (major story = full, subplot = moderate)
      - Supporting character depth based on Q13 answers (full/moderate/brief)

      **Architecture profiles internally (don't write yet)**:
      - Protagonist: Fear drives flaw, flaw creates conflict, arc resolves flaw
      - Supporting: Relationship to protagonist shapes their role
      - Dynamics: Key relationships have tension/chemistry from answers

      Protagonist: [Brief description with fear, flaw, arc]
      Key Supporting: [2-3 character concepts]

      Yeh direction sahi hai? Kuch adjust karna hai?"

      If user wants changes, adjust before full profile creation.

      └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

      **For PROTAGONIST, create FULL profile using answers:**

      **1. BASIC INFORMATION**
      - From story synopsis + your answers

      **2. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION** (from Q5):
      - Use EXACT details user provided
      - Age, build, face, clothing, distinguishing marks
      - Body language (from Q5 answer)

      **3. PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE** (from Q1, Q3, Q7):
      - Core personality (from story + answers)
      - Strengths/capabilities (from story)
      - **FLAW from Q3** (pride? cowardice? dishonesty?)
      - **FEAR from Q1** (failure? abandonment? exposure?)
      - Core desires (from story Q7 - what they want)
      - Motivations (WHY they act)
      - **Internal conflict** (flaw + fear create this)

      **4. BACKSTORY** (from Q2):
      - **KEY SHAPING EVENT from Q2** (ONE pivotal moment)
      - Family background (relevant to story)
      - Education/training (if relevant)
      - Events leading to story

      **5. CHARACTER ARC** (from Q6):
      - Starting point (from story beginning)
      - Journey (story events)
      - **TRANSFORMATION from Q6** (what they learn/change)
      - Ending point (who they become - from Q6)
      - Cost of change

      **6. SPEAKING VOICE** (from Q4):
      - **SPEECH PATTERN from Q4** (formal? casual? regional? witty?)
      - Hindi-English balance (based on character background)
      - Vocabulary level (educated? simple?)
      - Verbal tics if mentioned
      - Sample dialogue in their voice

      **7. BEHAVIORAL TRAITS**:
      - Physical mannerisms (if mentioned in answers)
      - Stress reactions (based on fear from Q1)
      - Comfort habits
      - Energy level

      **8. RELATIONSHIPS** (from Q9-Q14):
      - With each major character (use answers from Q9-Q13)
      - Nature of relationships (help? hinder? complex?)
      - Key dynamics from Q14 (top 2-3 relationships)

      **CRITICAL**: Use user's SPECIFIC answers, not generic template!
      - Their fear from Q1, not generic fear
      - Their flaw from Q3, not common flaw
      - Their transformation from Q6, not standard arc

      **SECONDARY CHARACTER DEPTH FLOOR (mandatory — every supporting character):**

      *Supporting characters ko paragraph mein nipataana galat hai. Woh bhi log hain.*

      Every supporting character MUST have AT MINIMUM:

      FLOOR 1 — THE WANT THAT DRIVES THEM IN EVERY SCENE:
      → Not the story goal — the moment-to-moment want shaping their behavior

      FLOOR 2 — THE ONE THING THEY HIDE:
      → What they never show other characters (but audience slowly sees)
      → Without this: character is what they appear to be = flat

      FLOOR 3 — THEIR NEED FROM THE PROTAGONIST (unspoken):
      → What do they need from protagonist that they never ask for directly?
      → This unspoken exchange = subtext of every scene between them

      FLOOR 4 — ONE SPECIFIC MEMORY:
      → ONE scene from their past, 2 sentences, explains present behavior
      → Should be usable as a FLASHBACK SCENE in screenplay

      FLOOR 5 — EXIT MOMENT:
      → Their last scene — what do they DO in it?
      → Does it show who they BECAME (not just what happened to them)?

      Secondary Character Depth Check (before approving any supporting character):
      1. Want identified? 2. One hidden thing defined? 3. Need from protagonist? 4. One specific memory? 5. Exit moment designed?
      Any NO = character not ready → fill before proceeding to screenplay.

      Background characters (tertiary — minimum): one want + one distinguishing behavior.
      "Tea stall owner who always listens but never speaks about himself" > "Tea stall owner"

      **CHARACTER EXIT DESIGN (mandatory — every major character):**

      *Kisi bhi character ka aakhri scene uska poora arc define karta hai.*

      Exit Moment Question: "Is character ka AAKHRI scene kya hai — aur woh scene us character ke baare mein kya kehta hai?"

      THREE EXIT TYPES:
      TYPE 1 — COMPLETION EXIT: Character completes their arc
        → Last scene's action = who they became | No explanation, just one choice
      TYPE 2 — RECOGNITION EXIT: Character sees themselves clearly for the first time
        → They don't change, but they acknowledge what they are | Camera holds. Cut.
      TYPE 3 — CONTINUATION EXIT: Story doesn't end for them — life goes on
        → Last scene shows impact of story on them | Best for supporting characters

      Add to every major character's profile:
      Exit Type: [Completion/Recognition/Continuation]
      Last Scene: [2-3 sentences what happens]
      Key Action/Line: [one specific thing they do/say]
      Connection to Contradiction: [does exit resolve or acknowledge their core contradiction?]

      Exit Stress Test:
      → Can you describe this character's exit in ONE sentence? NO = not designed yet
      → Does it show CHARACTER (who they are) not just PLOT (what happened)? NO = redesign
      → No major character proceeds to screenplay without exit moment designed.

    outputs:
      - Complete profiles for all principal characters
      - Deep psychological understanding
      - Clear character arcs

    agent: character-developer

    action: |
      **For EACH major supporting character, create profile using Q9-Q13 answers:**

      **Depth level determined by Q13 answer**:

      IF Q13 = "Full Depth":
        Create similar to protagonist (8 aspects, less detail)

      IF Q13 = "Moderate":
        Create focused profile:
        - Basic info (name, age, occupation, role)
        - Physical description (casting-ready)
        - **Relationship to protagonist from Q9** (family? friend? rival?)
        - **What they want from Q10** (approval? help? distance?)
        - **Role from Q11** (ally? obstacle? catalyst?)
        - **MEMORABLE TRAIT from Q12** (specific quirk/behavior)
        - Voice pattern basics (Hindi-English mix)
        - Key behaviors

      IF Q13 = "Brief":
        Create minimal profile:
        - Basic info
        - **MEMORABLE TRAIT from Q12** (one thing that makes them stand out)
        - **Role from Q11** (functional purpose)
        - Brief physical description

      **CRITICAL**: Use user's SPECIFIC answers from Q9-Q13
      - Not generic "supportive friend" but their specific relationship from Q9
      - Not vague "wants to help" but their specific want from Q10
      - Not "funny sidekick" but their specific quirk from Q12

    outputs:
      - Profiles for all supporting characters
      - Character consistency established

  - step: 7
    name: "Define Minor Characters"
    agent: character-developer

    action: |
      For EACH minor character, create brief profile:

      - Name, age, role
      - One-line description
      - Key trait or purpose
      - Brief appearance note

      Just enough so they're not generic placeholders.

      For each major relationship:
      - Connection type (family/romantic/professional/antagonistic)
      - History (how they know each other)
      - Current state (relationship now)
      - Conflict points (what divides them)
      - Bond points (what connects them)
      - Power dynamic (who has power, what kind)
      - Evolution (how relationship changes in story)

      Show how characters affect each other.

    outputs:
      - Relationship dynamics map
      - Connection web

    name: "Character Voice Distinction (Based on Q4)"
    agent: character-developer

    action: |
      **Ensure each character sounds DISTINCT using Q4 answers:**

      For each principal/supporting character:
      - **Use SPEECH PATTERN from Q4** (formal? casual? regional? witty?)
      - Define Hindi-English ratio (from Q4 + character background)
      - Identify word choice patterns (educated? street-smart?)
      - Note verbal tics or repeated phrases (if mentioned in Q4)
      - Describe speech rhythm (fast? slow? terse?)
      - Create sample dialogue (3-4 lines in their distinct voice)

      **Simple Bollywood Hindi default (60-70% Hindi mix)**

      Test: Can you tell who's speaking without seeing name?
      If not, make voices more distinct.

    outputs:
      - Distinct voice for each character
      - Sample dialogue demonstrating voices

      **For each principal character, summarize arc using Q6 answer:**

      **Beginning**:
      - Who they are
      - What they believe
      - What they want
      - **Their flaw/wound from Q3** (pride? cowardice?)

      **Journey**:
      - Key story events that test them
      - Choices that define them
      - What they learn

      **Transformation (from Q6 answer)**:
      - **How they change (Q6: what did user say they learn/change?)**
      - What they overcome (flaw from Q3 resolved?)
      - Cost of change

      **End**:
      - **Who they've become (from Q6)**
      - What they've gained/lost

      **CRITICAL**: Arc must match user's Q6 answer about transformation!

      **BLIND VOICE TEST (Mandatory — run before approving):**

      Take 5 dialogue lines from each major character. Remove all character names.
      Present internally: "Inhe padhke batao — kaun bol raha hai?"

      RESULT FORMAT (show to user):
      ```
      BLIND VOICE TEST:

      [Character 1 Name]: 5 lines without names shown
      AI identification: [Correct X/5]
      Assessment: [✅ Voice distinct (4-5/5) / ⚠️ Voice blurring (2-3/5) — rewrite speech profile]

      [Character 2 Name]: Same test
      [Continue for all major characters]

      FAIL threshold: Any character below 4/5 → Character Bible incomplete.
      Fix: Rewrite speech patterns (Q4 answers) before proceeding.
      ```

      **ANTAGONIST MIRROR TEST (if antagonist exists):**

      5 mandatory checks before approving antagonist:
      ```
      A1. Antagonist ke perspective se — protagonist kya GALAT kar raha hai?
          (Not evil perspective — their logic from their own worldview)
          → [AI states antagonist's rationale in 2 sentences]

      A2. Antagonist ki apni story mein woh HERO hai. Woh story kya hai?
          → [2-sentence antagonist's self-narrative]

      A3. Antagonist ka wound — kya yeh protagonist ke wound ka mirror hai?
          → [✅ Mirror found: [how] / ⚠️ No mirror — antagonist feels like obstacle, not character]

      A4. Agar antagonist jeet jaaye — audience ke liye woh understandable (not likeable) hoga?
          → [✅ / ⚠️ Antagonist too cartoonish — add human logic]

      A5. Ek scene jahan protagonist aur antagonist same choice karte hain — dono mein koi difference nahi dikhta.
          → [Scene identified: / ⚠️ No such scene — story's moral complexity is absent]
      ```

      description: "Complete character profiles, relationships, arcs"

estimated_time: "1-2 hours for 5-minute film (5-8 characters typical)"

notes: |
  Character Bible is STEP 2 in development workflow:

  1. Story Synopsis ✅
  2. Character Bible ⬅️ (This step)
  3. Screenplay (uses character bible)

  Characters must be developed BEFORE screenplay so:
  - Dialogue reflects distinct voices
  - Actions align with motivations
  - Arcs are tracked through scenes
  - Relationships are consistent
  - Actors have full character understanding

  Good Character Bible = Better Screenplay
