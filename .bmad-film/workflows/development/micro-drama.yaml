  **MICRO DRAMA DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM** — Compressed architecture for short-episode series.

  **Core Rules of Micro Drama Storytelling:**

  EPISODE = ONE EMOTIONAL BEAT. Not a full story.
  Every episode delivers ONE feeling, ONE relationship moment, ONE revelation.
  That's it. Everything else serves this one thing.

  DIALOGUE IS PRIMARY. In 3-7 minutes, you cannot afford breathing room.
  Every line must do double duty: advance plot AND reveal character.
  Silence is expensive. Use it only for maximum impact.

  WORLD = INSTANTLY RECOGNIZABLE. No setup allowed.
  Episode 1 must establish world in 60 seconds.
  Episodes 2+ assume audience knows the world.

  ONE RELATIONSHIP = THE WHOLE SERIES. Every episode is about this relationship
  at a different moment. The relationship IS the story.

  SUBTEXT IS THE EPISODE. What's NOT said = what the episode is actually about.
  In 5 minutes, there's no time to approach the real subject directly.
  The real subject lives in the gaps.

  **8 Story Elements — Micro Drama Treatment:**

  CHARACTER: One trait revealed per episode (not full arc). Character is shown
  through ACTION only — no time for backstory.

  RELATIONSHIP: ONE core relationship — this IS the series. Every episode
  explores one moment in this relationship's evolution.

  EMOTION: Single emotion per episode. Punchy. Immediate. Audience feels it
  within 60 seconds and it stays with them after the episode ends.

  PLOT: One scene = one beat = one episode. No B-story. No subplot.
  Everything serves the episode's ONE moment.

  WORLD: Instantly recognizable with ONE specific twist that makes it this
  world and no other. Established in Episode 1, assumed from Episode 2.

  CONFLICT: Compressed. One line establishes the conflict.
  Everything else is the collision.

  THEME: Never stated. Only felt. Emerges from ALL episodes combined —
  no single episode carries the theme alone.

  SUBTEXT: IS the episode. What is not said in 3-7 minutes is what the episode
  is about. The title, the scene choice, the dialogue — all point to the unsaid.

      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      📍 STEP 0 of 8 — Micro Drama Concept Intake
      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      ```

      **Format Questions (ask first):**

      MF1. "Kitne episodes banane hain? (10 / 20 / 30 / 50 / doosra)"
      MF2. "Ek episode kitna lamba hoga? (2-3 min / 3-5 min / 5-7 min)"
      MF3. "Platform kaun sa? (YouTube Shorts / Instagram Reels / OTT / Television)"
      MF4. "Format vertical hai (phone ke liye 9:16) ya horizontal (16:9)?"

      **CONCEPT MINING (Before Seeds — Mandatory):**
      Writer ke concept mein se 3-5 threads nikalo. Jo unhone kaha — literally unke words use karo.
      "Tumne [X] kaha — yeh interesting hai. Aur [Y] mention kiya..."
      Tab seeds shuru karo.

      **40/60 MODEL: Writer 10 deep seeds deta hai (Micro Drama ke liye compressed).**
      **AI 60% series architecture un seeds se banata hai.**
      Ek seed at a time. Main Q → jawab lo → Depth Probe → jawab lo → next seed.
      Depth Probe skip karna FORBIDDEN. Micro drama mein words kam hain —
      isliye har depth probe AUR zyada zaroori hai.

      **GROUP 1 — CORE + RELATIONSHIP (MS1–MS5)**

      MS1. KHINCHAV + PEHLI IMAGE (Origin + Visual in One)
           Main Q: "Yeh series kab se hai tumhare andar? Aur is series ka woh ek image
           jo tumhe nahi chhodta — Episode 1 ka. Describe karo exactly."
           Depth Probe: "Woh image mein light kaisi hai — andhera zyada ya roshni?
           Koi sound hai ya khamoshi? Aur yeh real se connected hai kya — koi memory?"

      MS2. CORE RELATIONSHIP (The Whole Series)
           Main Q: "Yeh ek relationship ki story hai.
           Kaun hai woh do log? Officially kya hain — actually kya hain?"
           Depth Probe: "Pehli baar jab yeh dono mile — exactly kya feel hua?
           Aur ek cheez batao jo in dono ne kabhi same direction mein nahi dekhi."

      MS3. THE UNSAID (Series Engine)
           Main Q: "Is relationship mein ek cheez hai jo kabhi nahi kahi gayi.
           Agar yeh cheez ek baar kahi gayi — series khatam hogi. Woh kya hai?"
           Depth Probe: "Agar yeh unsaid cheez sirf ek sentence mein kahi jaaye —
           kaun kehta hai, aur kab? Poori series mein kaunsa episode sabse close aata hai
           is sentence ke? Kahi jaayegi final episode mein — ya phir bhi nahi?"

      MS4. WORLD + CONSTRAINT (Setting as Character)
           Main Q: "Yeh story kahan hoti hai?
           Ek sentence mein — jaise koi 5 second mein picture mein dekhe."
           Depth Probe: "Is world ka ek aisa rule ya pressure hai jo yeh do log mahsoos karte hain
           — jo unhe rok ke rakhta hai. Exactly kya hai woh rule?
           Aur is world mein ek cheez hai jo SIRF IS WORLD MEIN HAI — koi aur jagah mein nahi.
           Woh kya hai?"

      MS5. CHARACTER WOUNDS (Who They Really Are)
           Main Q: "Pehle character ko ek word mein describe karo.
           Doosre character ko ek word mein describe karo."
           Depth Probe: "Pehle character ka woh wound — kab se hai? Koi ek moment jab woh hurt hua.
           Doosra character — woh wound jaanta hai ya nahi?
           Yeh jaanna/na jaanna hi relationship ki core dynamic hai."

      **GROUP 2 — ARC + TONE (MS6–MS10)**

      MS6. EMOTIONAL JOURNEY (Start to End)
           Main Q: "Is series mein emotions ka range kya hai?
           Episode 1 mein audience kya feel karta hai — final episode ke baad kya feel karta hai?"
           Depth Probe: "Woh emotional journey — tumhari khud ki zindagi mein kisi cheez se
           connected hai? Koi baar tumhe yeh exact transition aayi thi?"

      MS7. AAKHRI IMAGE + EPISODE 1 CONTRAST (Resolution)
           Main Q: "Series ka aakhri episode — last image. Kaun hai frame mein, kya ho raha hai?"
           Depth Probe: "Episode 1 ki pehli image (MS1) se yeh last image kaise different hai?
           Series mein kya badla — woh difference is image mein kaise dikhta hai?
           Protagonist akela hai ya saath — aur presence ya absence kyun?"

      MS8. FEEL REFERENCE (Hyper-Specific Tone)
           Main Q: "Koi ek film ya series jis ki FEEL tumhari series se milti hai —
           story nahi, sirf feel."
           Depth Probe: "Us film mein ek specific scene jo us feel ko best represent karta hai —
           woh 2-3 minute ka scene describe karo."

      MS9. JO BILKUL NAHI CHAHIYE (Anti-Cliché Guard)
           Main Q: "Ek cheez jo is series mein tum definitely NAHI chahte —
           koi cliché, koi trope, koi familiar pattern."
           Depth Probe: "Agar woh cheez accidentally aa jaaye —
           audience ko exactly kya feel hoga jo tum NAHI chahte? Woh feeling batao."

      MS10. SUBTEXT + HOOK + FORMAT (Micro-Specific)
            Main Q: "Ek cheez jo poori series mein kabhi directly nahi kahi jaayegi
            par neeche behti rahegi. Kitne episodes? Platform kaun sa?"
            Depth Probe: "Woh subtext — ek sentence mein kya hai jo audience samjhe
            poori series dekhne ke baad?
            Woh hook jo har episode ke end mein audience ko next episode tak kheenche —
            kaunsa type? Aur is platform pe audience kis mood mein watch karta hai?"

      **MANDATORY RULES:**
      1. Concept Mining PEHLE — seeds baad mein
      2. Depth Probe MANDATORY har seed ke baad — skip strictly forbidden
      3. Ek seed at a time — Main Q + Probe + phir next seed
      4. Koi option mat do — khule sawal only
      5. Micro drama = 3-7 min episodes. Seeds compress hain par depth SAME hai.

      ```

      **PURPOSE: Writer ke 10 micro seeds se AI puri SERIES architecture propose karta hai.**

      **STEP 1: PASS 0 — SEED TRACEABILITY (run internally before showing user)**
      Har proposed element ke liye check karo: "Yeh kaunse seed se aaya?"

      Seed → What it drives at SERIES level:
      - MS1 (khinchav + image + real origin) → Series emotional reason + visual grammar
      - MS2 (core pair + first meeting + divergence) → Relationship DNA
      - MS3 (unsaid + sentence + episode + said/not-said) → Subtext engine across episodes
      - MS4 (world + rule + unique detail) → Setting as character, world constraint
      - MS5 (words + wounds + known/unknown) → Character psychology, relationship dynamic
      - MS6 (emotion start → end + personal connect) → Series emotional arc
      - MS7 (last image + MS1 contrast) → Series arc, transformation proof
      - MS8 (feel reference + specific scene) → Tone, pacing, episode rhythm
      - MS9 (what not to have + feeling to avoid) → Anti-pattern map
      - MS10 (subtext + hook + format) → Originality layer, episode engine, platform strategy

      RULE: Koi bhi proposed element bina seed se trace kiye nahi rahega.
            Agar trace nahi hota → AI generic default hai → HATA DO.

      **STEP 2: GENERATE SERIES ARCHITECTURE — then USER KO DIKHAO:**

      ```

      📍 AI MICRO SERIES ARCHITECTURE PROPOSAL
      Tumhare 10 seeds se main yeh series architecture propose kar raha hoon:
      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

      GENRE READ: [Primary + Secondary] — from MS[X] + MS[X]

      CORE RELATIONSHIP ARCHITECTURE:
      → Official rishta: [AI proposal] — from MS2
      → Actual dynamic (what they really are): [AI proposal] — from MS2 depth probe

      → Final episode emotion + image: [AI proposal] — from MS6/MS7
      → Series transformation (S1 vs Final image contrast): [AI proposal] — from MS7 depth probe

      SUBTEXT + TONE + PLATFORM:

      → Tone texture: [AI proposal] — from MS8 specific scene
      → Episode hook engine: [AI proposal] — from MS10 depth probe
      → Platform strategy: [AI proposal] — from MS10 depth probe

    agent: "master-story-director"
    action: |
      **PURPOSE: Writer reacts to AI proposal. Yeh writer ka 40% hai — generating nahi, calibrating.**

      Quick aur targeted reactions. Har reaction architecture refines karta hai.

      **REACTION RULES:**
      - "Theek hai" → lock it, next element
      - "Wrong direction" → probe once: "Woh kya hoga toh?" → note → adjust
      - "Change karna hai" → "Exactly kya change?" → note → adjust
      - "Nahi samjha" → rephrase using writer's own seed words
      - After all reactions: synthesize CONFIRMED series architecture

      **AFTER ALL REACTIONS — SYNTHESIZE + CONFIRM:**

      ```
      Theek hai! Confirmed micro series architecture:

      ✓ Core relationship (official + actual): [final — seed + calibration]
      ✓ Character wounds + known/unknown dynamic: [final]
      ✓ The unsaid (sentence + closest episode + said/not-said finale): [final]
      ✓ World + rule + unique detail: [final]
      ✓ Series arc (Ep 1 emotion/image → Final emotion/image): [final]
      ✓ Subtext sentence (runs through every episode): [final]
      ✓ Tone + hook engine + platform strategy: [final]
      ✓ What to avoid: [final]

      Sab confirm hai? Ab Micro Series Bible likhta hoon.
      ```

      Pass this CONFIRMED SERIES ARCHITECTURE to STEP 1 (Bible Creation).

      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      ```

      **BEFORE WRITING BIBLE — 3 MANDATORY PASSES:**

      **PASS 0 — SEED TRACEABILITY FINAL CHECK (Run FIRST):**
      Bible ka final version likhne se pehle — har element trace karo:
      - Core relationship dynamic → MS2 depth probe (first meeting + divergence)? Agar nahi → REWRITE
      - Character wound → MS5 depth probe (moment + known/unknown)? Agar nahi → REWRITE
      - The unsaid sentence → MS3 depth probe? Agar nahi → REWRITE
      - World rule + unique detail → MS4 depth probe? Agar nahi → REWRITE
      - Series arc (start → end images) → MS1 + MS7 depth probe? Agar nahi → REWRITE
      - Subtext current → MS10 subtext sentence? Agar nahi → REWRITE
      ZERO TOLERANCE: Koi bhi untraced element = generic AI default = hatao.

      **PASS 1 — ANTI-PATTERN FILTER (OUTPUT TO USER — MANDATORY):**
      Is micro series ki 3 sabse predictable versions identify karo.
      Phir inhe USER KO DIKHAO — Bible likhne se PEHLE.

      **USER KO DIKHAO (MANDATORY FORMAT):**
      ```
      Is series ke teen sabse predictable versions jo main NAHI likh raha:

      ❌ Version 1: [Generic micro drama version — 1-2 lines, relationship/genre se related]
      ❌ Version 2: [Generic version — alag common pattern]
      ❌ Version 3: [Generic version — ek aur familiar trap]

      Yeh teeno avoid kiye gaye hain. Ab 4th version ki Bible likh raha hoon.
      ```

      **DIVERGE BEFORE CONVERGE (MANDATORY — before Bible is written):**
      3 genuinely different series directions writer ke OWN seeds se:

      ```
      Tumhare seeds mein teen alag micro series directions dikh rahi hain:

      🔵 Direction A — [Series direction — from MS1 image + MS7 final image contrast]
         [Writer's specific seed that generates this direction]
         Series Feel: [Dark/Quiet/Tense — 1-2 words]

      🟡 Direction B — [Series direction — from MS2/MS3 relationship + unsaid]
         [Writer's specific seed that generates this direction]
         Series Feel: [1-2 words]

      🔴 Direction C — [Series direction — from MS10 subtext + MS9 avoidance]
         [Writer's specific seed that generates this direction]
         Series Feel: [1-2 words]

      Kaunsa series sabse tumhari lagti hai?
      Ya koi do directions mila sakte ho?
      ```

      Lock direction. Tab Bible likho.

      **World Rule:** [The one rule/pressure that constrains both characters]
      **World's One Unique Detail:** [The specific thing that exists ONLY in this world]

      ---

      ## CHARACTERS

      ---

      ## CORE RELATIONSHIP
      *Yeh ek relationship ki story hai. Series ka har episode is relationship
      ka ek moment hai.*

      **Relationship Type (Official):** [Brother/Sister, Boss/Employee, etc.]
      **Relationship Type (Actual):** [What they really are to each other]

      **First 3 Seconds:** [What must happen in first 3 seconds to stop scrolling]
      **Episode Thumbnail Strategy:** [What makes audience click]

      ## DIALOGUE ECONOMY LAW
      *Micro drama mein dialogue IS the story. Har line double duty kare.*

      **RULE 1 — DOUBLE DUTY MANDATORY:**
      Har line do cheezein ek saath kare — plot advance + character reveal.
      ✅ "Khaana thanda ho gaya." = Time passed (plot) + She stopped caring to warm it (character)
      ❌ "Khaana thanda ho gaya kyunki main bahut busy tha." = Explanation only — single duty

      **RULE 2 — APPROACH SIDEWAYS:**
      Real subject ko directly mat kaho. Character always talks about something else.
      Real subject: "Main tumse pyaar karta hoon."
      What character says: "Tum aaj bhi wahi shirt pehnti ho." ✅

      **RULE 3 — SILENCE IS EXPENSIVE:**
      Silence = 10 seconds minimum in a 3-min episode = 6% of runtime.
      Use ONLY at maximum impact. Cheap silence = leaked time.

      **RULE 4 — NO EXPOSITION:**
      Characters know their own world. They don't explain it to each other.
      ❌ "Jab se papa ne zameen bech di..." (exposition)
      ✅ "Zameen ki baat mat karo." (implies history, creates curiosity)

      **Episode QA**: Before finalizing any episode — "Is har line ka double duty hai?"

      ---

      ## AI VISUAL CHARACTER SEEDS
      *For AI video generation — naam nahi, visual anchors. Consistency is everything.*

      ### [CHARACTER 1 NAME] — AI Visual Seed:
      **Age + Build:** [e.g., "28 saal, medium height, slim build"]
      **Hair:** [e.g., "Shoulder-length dark hair, slight wave, no accessories"]
      **Face:** [e.g., "Oval face, large dark eyes, slightly full lips"]
      **Clothing Anchor:** [e.g., "White cotton kurta + blue jeans — STAYS CONSISTENT across episodes"]
      **Default Expression:** [e.g., "Pensive with slight tension at jaw"]
      **Voice Tone (Veo3):** [e.g., "Soft, measured — when she raises voice, it's significant"]

      ### [CHARACTER 2 NAME] — AI Visual Seed:
      **Age + Build:** [...]
      **Hair:** [...]
      **Face:** [...]
      **Clothing Anchor:** [STAYS CONSISTENT — document any planned costume change in Episode Arc Map]
      **Default Expression:** [...]
      **Voice Tone (Veo3):** [...]

      **AI CONSISTENCY RULE:** Clothing anchor = character continuity anchor.
      Every AI prompt must include FULL visual description — not just name.
      Costume change = story beat (planned) OR continuity error (unplanned).

      MICRO-SPECIFIC ADDITIONS:
      After Q5 (The Unsaid), ask:
      "Yeh 'unsaid' kab episodes mein sabse CLOSE ata hai kaha jaane ke?
       Un moments ko list karo — yeh hi series ke key episodes honge."

      After Q7 (Transformation):
      "Yeh rishta episode-by-episode kaise badlega? Ek table banao:
       Episode 1-5: [State] | Episode 6-N: [State] | Final: [State]"

      Create the complete episode map — ALL episodes visible at once.
      This is the navigation document. No episode gets written without this.

      **ESCALATION LADDER (distribute across 7 mandatory phases):**

      For [X] episode series, plan these 7 phases:

      PHASE 1 — Initial Opposition (Ep 1 to ~15% of total):
      "In donoṅ ke beech kya wall hai? Audience samajh le — Episode 1 mein."
      Episodes: [X to X] | What wall: [...]

      PHASE 2 — Forced Proximity (Ep ~15% to ~30%):
      "Kaunsi situation hai jo inhe baar baar saath laati hai — unwillingly?"
      Episodes: [X to X] | The situation: [...]

      PHASE 3 — First Genuine Connection (Ep ~30% to ~45%):
      "Woh ek moment — jahan dono ke liye reality shift hoti hai. First crack in the wall."
      Episodes: [X to X] | The crack: [...]

      PHASE 4 — Separation Threat (Ep ~45% to ~55%):
      "Koi third party, koi decision, koi past — jo inhe wapas alag karne ki koshish karta hai."
      Episodes: [X to X] | The threat: [...]

      PHASE 5 — The Major Revelation (~55% to ~70%):
      "Woh cheez jo sab kuch recontextualize kare — about one of them, about their past."
      Episodes: [X to X] | The revelation: [...]

      PHASE 6 — Final Obstacle (~70% to ~85%):
      "Last biggest wall — jo lagta hai insurmountable hai."
      Episodes: [X to X] | The obstacle: [...]

      PHASE 7 — Resolution (~85% to 100%):
      "Unsaid — kahi jaati hai ya nahi? Series ka full circle moment."
      Episodes: [X to X] | Resolution: [Does unsaid get said? Yes/No/Almost]

      ---

      **PAYWALL ENGINEERING (Indian platforms — Episodes 10-15):**

      PAYWALL EPISODE: Episode [10-15 — designate exact number]

      Paywall episode MUST have:
      1. Series ka MAXIMUM TENSION moment — relationship at breaking point OR breakthrough
      2. "The Unsaid" (MS3) — is episode mein sabse CLOSE aata hai kehne ke
      3. One character decision audience CANNOT predict
      4. Episode ends WITHOUT resolution — paid content resolves this

      Question: "Kaunsa episode pe audience ZAROOR next episode dekhna chahegi — even if they have to pay?"
      → That episode = paywall episode.

      RULE: Paywall episode = non-negotiable quality gate.
      Weak paywall episode → series won't convert free viewers to paid.

      **For each episode — one line:**
      Episode [X]: [What happens in 1 sentence] | [Emotion delivered] | [Hook to next ep]

      **Save:** project/{name}/episode-arc-map.md

      **Format:**
      ```markdown
      # EPISODE ARC MAP
      ## Project: {name}
      ## Total Episodes: [X]

      ## ARC OVERVIEW
      Arc 1 (Ep 01-0X): [What arc 1 is about]
      Arc 2 (Ep 0X-XX): [What arc 2 is about]
      Arc 3 (Ep XX-XX): [What arc 3 is about — series finale]

      ## EPISODE-BY-EPISODE

      | Ep | What Happens | Emotion Delivered | Relationship State | Hook |
      |---|---|---|---|---|
      | 01 | [One sentence] | [One emotion] | [Relationship moment] | [Pull to Ep 2] |
      | 02 | [One sentence] | [One emotion] | [Relationship moment] | [Pull to Ep 3] |

      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      ```

      Read: micro-series-bible.md + character-relations.md + episode-arc-map.md (Episode XX entry).

      **MICRO DRAMA COMPRESSED FORMAT:**

      Each episode = combined synopsis + screenplay in ONE file.
      Standard INT./EXT. format is too space-wasteful — use compressed format:

      ```markdown
      # EPISODE [XX] — [Title]
      ## Duration: [X] min
      ## Emotion: [This episode's designated emotion]
      ## Relationship State: [What state is the relationship in this episode]

      ---

      ## SCROLL-STOP FRAME (0-3 seconds — MANDATORY)
      *Har episode MUST open mid-emotion. Not mid-setup. This stops the scroll.*

      **Opening Frame:** [Exactly who is in frame, what emotion on their face]
      **Opening Action/Line:** [What is happening or being said — mid-conversation or mid-moment]
      **Scroll-Stop Test:** "Kya yeh 3 second mein scroll rokta hai?" → YES/NO
      *FORBIDDEN openings: Character waking up / Walking into a place / Establishing shot / Setup dialogue*
      *REQUIRED openings: Mid-argument / Mid-revelation / Mid-decision / Mid-emotion*

      ---

      ## MICRO-RECAP (Ep 2 onwards — skip for Ep 1)
      *[One line — what audience needs to remember from previous episode]*

      ---

      ## EPISODE SCRIPT

      [LOCATION — TIME]
      [Scene description: 2 lines MAXIMUM]

      CHARACTER NAME
      [Dialogue line]

      CHARACTER NAME
      [Dialogue line — subtext always present]

      [Action: 1 line only — what camera MUST see]

      CHARACTER NAME
      [Dialogue]

      [Continue...]

      ---

      ## EPISODE HOOK
      [Final moment — what pulls audience to next episode]
      [This is the last thing they see/hear. Make it count.]

      ---

      ## DIRECTOR NOTES
      **The Unsaid This Episode:** [What is NOT said that this whole episode is about]
      **Subtext Signature:** [Use from character-relations.md — how it appears this episode]
      **Key Shot:** [One shot that carries the entire episode's subtext visually]
      ```

      **COMPRESSED FORMAT RULES:**
      - Scene description: 2 lines MAXIMUM. No exceptions.
      - Dialogue: PRIMARY story carrier. Every line does two things.
      - Action lines: Only what camera ABSOLUTELY must see.
      - Micro-recap: Ep 1 = none. Ep 2+ = one line only.
      - Episode hook: Last image or line. Non-negotiable.

      **DIALOGUE RULES FOR MICRO DRAMA:**
      - Characters NEVER say what they mean directly.
      - The real subject is always approached sideways.
      - Subtext signature from character-relations.md appears every episode.
      - One line per episode that carries the entire series theme.

      **EPISODE QA CHECKLIST (run before finalizing):**
      - [ ] Does this episode deliver its ONE designated emotion?
      - [ ] Is the 'unsaid' present but not stated?
      - [ ] Is the micro-recap present (Ep 2 onwards)?
      - [ ] Is the episode hook strong?
      - [ ] Can a new viewer partially understand this episode?
      - [ ] Is every line of dialogue doing double work?
      - [ ] 2-line scene description rule followed?

      EPISODE [XX] STRESS TEST:

      1. SCROLL-STOP: First 3 seconds opens mid-emotion (not mid-setup)?
         → [✅ / ⚠️ Opening too slow — rewrite scroll-stop frame]

      2. DOUBLE DUTY DIALOGUE: Har important line do cheezein karta hai?
         → [✅ / ⚠️ Line X is single duty — rewrite]

      3. THE UNSAID PRESENT: Is episode mein relationship ka unsaid moment felt hota hai?
         → [✅ / ⚠️ Subtext surface pe aa gayi — pull it under]

      4. ESCALATION PHASE: Is episode apne designated phase mein sahi hai?
         → [Phase X — ✅ On track / ⚠️ Episode out of phase]

      5. EPISODE HOOK: Last 5-10 seconds ka hook strong hai — next episode feel necessary?
         → [✅ / ⚠️ Hook too weak — suggest stronger cliffhanger]

      6. PAYWALL CHECK (if this is paywall episode):
         → [✅ Maximum tension present / ⚠️ Needs escalation]
      ```

      If any check fails → revise before marking episode complete.
      Move to next episode only after current episode passes stress test.

success_criteria:
  - "Series Bible created before any episode written"
  - "Character Relations Map created before Episode Arc Map"
  - "Episode Arc Map complete and approved before any individual episode"
  - "Each episode delivers ONE emotion, explores ONE relationship moment"
  - "The Unsaid maintained across series — not revealed until designated episode"
  - "Compressed screenplay format used — 2-line scene descriptions honored"
  - "Micro-recap present in all episodes except Episode 1"
  - "Every episode hook strong enough to pull to next episode"
  - "Hindi language standards maintained throughout"

tips:
  - "Series Bible pehle — episode arc map doosra — phir episode scripts. Is order ko kabhi mat todo."
  - "Har episode ek emotion deliver karta hai — agar do emotions hain toh episode focus nahi hai"
  - "Dialogue mein subtext hamesha. Jo kaha gaya ≠ jo sach mein kehna chahte"
  - "Micro-recap ek line — zyada nahi, kam nahi. Jo audience ne miss kiya ho woh recap nahi — jo zaroori hai woh recap"
  - "Hook = question + emotion. Sirf mystery ya sirf emotion — dono nahi chalega"
  - "The Unsaid protect karo. Agar kisi episode mein directly bol diya — series khatam ho gayi"

philosophy: |
  Micro Drama ka magic yeh hai ki bahut kam time mein bahut zyada feel hota hai.

  3 minute mein ek emotion. 5 minute mein ek relationship shift.
  7 minute mein ek moment jo audience ko raat bhar sochata rakhey.

  Yeh possible hai sirf ek tarike se — subtext.
  Jo characters NAHI bolte, woh hi story hai.
  Jo screen pe NAHI dikhta, woh hi emotion hai.

  Har episode ek iceberg hai.
  Audience sirf upar wala hissa dekhti hai —
  lekin neeche ki feeling unhe kheenchti rehti hai, episode darvaaza band karne ke baad bhi.

  Yeh "unsaid" — yahi micro drama ka asli hero hai.
  Use protect karo. Use respect karo. Aur sahi waqt pe, sirf sahi waqt pe — use kehne do.
