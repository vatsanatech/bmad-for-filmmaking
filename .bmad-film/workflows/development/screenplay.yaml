  **INTERACTIVE CO-WRITING + MULTI-DIALECT SUPPORT** - Creates screenplay through questions, with automatic multi-language dialect support.

  **NEW IN v6.0**: Automatic multi-dialect screenplay creation!
  If character-bible was created in multiple dialects, screenplay automatically creates versions for each dialect.

  **3-PHASE PROCESS**:

  **Phase 0: Dialect Auto-Detection (NEW!)**
  - Reads dialect preferences from character-bible workflow
  - If multi-dialect character-bible exists → Creates screenplay per dialect
  - Dialogue automatically adapted to each regional language
  - Same scene structure, localized dialogue

  **Phase 1: Screenplay Questions (15 questions)**
  - Screenplay Structure Writer asks 10 questions (style, pacing, scenes)
  - Dialogue Writer asks 5 questions (language ratio, dialect, memorable lines)
  - Understands YOUR vision for scenes, dialogue, visual storytelling

  **Phase 2: Collaborative Refinement**
  - Present structure approach based on answers
  - You refine key scenes/dialogue beats
  - Iterates until screenplay direction feels RIGHT

  **Phase 3: Screenplay Creation**
  - Structure Writer creates scenes/action (same for all dialects)
  - Dialogue Writer polishes dialogue per dialect (from character-bible voice profiles)
  - **IF MULTI-DIALECT**: Creates separate screenplay-{dialect}.md files
  - Two-agent Bollywood authentic approach
  - Output: Complete screenplay(s) matching your vision

  **BOLLYWOOD TWO-AGENT MODEL**:
  1. Screenplay Structure Writer - Visual foundation (scenes, action, pacing)
  2. Dialogue Writer (Samvad Lekhak) - Impactful dialogue per dialect

  Creates UNIQUE screenplay based on your 15 answers, not generic template.
  Supports single language (default: Hindi) OR multiple Indian dialects automatically.

  This runs AFTER character-bible in development workflow.

  Input: Approved character bible(s) - single OR multi-dialect
  Output: Professional screenplay(s) - single file OR multiple dialect-specific files

      **🔴 MANDATORY: Read ALL these files BEFORE proceeding:**
      - `project/{project_name}/genre-analysis.md`
      - `project/{project_name}/story-synopsis.md`
      - `project/{project_name}/character-bible.md` (or dialect versions)
      - `project/{project_name}/beat-sheet.md` (if exists)

      **Auto-detect dialect preferences from character-bible:**

      **CHECK CHARACTER-BIBLE FILES**:

      Look in `project/{project_name}/` for:
      - Single file: `character-bible.md` → SINGLE DIALECT
      - Multiple folders: `hindi/`, `tamil/`, `telugu/` (with character-bible.md inside each) → MULTI-DIALECT

      ---

      **IF SINGLE DIALECT FOUND**:
      - Read: `character-bible.md`
      - Extract: Language/dialect used (default: Hindi)
      - Setup: Create single screenplay file
      - Output: `screenplay.md`

      ---

      **IF MULTI-DIALECT FOUND**:
      - Count dialect folders: hindi/, tamil/, telugu/, etc.
      - Extract: List of dialects (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, etc.)
      - Setup: Prepare to create screenplay in each dialect folder
      - Output: `hindi/screenplay.md`, `tamil/screenplay.md`, `telugu/screenplay.md`, etc.

      **READ LOCALIZATION SETTINGS**:
      From each character-bible file, extract:
      - Localization depth (dialogue-only / full cultural)
      - Character names (adapted or universal)
      - Speech patterns per dialect
      - Cultural references strategy

      ---

      **INFORM USER**:

      IF SINGLE DIALECT:
      ```
      ✓ Character Bible detected: Single dialect (Hindi)
      → Will create: screenplay.md
      ```

      IF MULTI-DIALECT:
      ```
      ✓ Character Bibles detected: 3 dialects (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu)
      → Will create:
         - hindi/screenplay.md (Hindi dialogue)
         - tamil/screenplay.md (Tamil dialogue)
         - telugu/screenplay.md (Telugu dialogue)

      Same scenes, same structure, localized dialogue per dialect.
      ```

      **CONTINUE TO STEP 1** (Screenplay questions - same for all dialects)

    name: "Read Project Context (CRITICAL FOR CONSISTENCY)"
    agent: screenplay-structure-writer

    action: |
      **CRITICAL: Read ALL previous workflow outputs FIRST:**

      **MUST READ** (from previous workflows):
      1. `project/{project_name}/genre-analysis.md` - Genre, tone, visual style
      2. `project/{project_name}/story-synopsis.md` - **BOTH versions** (continuous narrative + scene-by-scene)
      3. `project/{project_name}/beat-sheet.md` - Beat-by-beat story breakdown, emotional mapping, pacing
      4. `project/{project_name}/character-bible.md` - Complete character profiles, voices, arcs
         - OR if multi-dialect: `project/{project_name}/{dialect}/character-bible.md` (read all dialects)

      **Extract for screenplay:**
      - Genre and tone (determines screenplay style) → FROM genre-analysis
      - All story beats (must be covered) → FROM beat-sheet (beat-by-beat breakdown)
      - Emotional progression map → FROM beat-sheet (highs/lows placement)
      - Pacing rhythm → FROM beat-sheet (fast/measured/slow burn)
      - Character roster with voice profiles → FROM character-bible
      - Character speech patterns (Q4 answers from character-bible)
      - Key relationships (affects dialogue dynamics) → FROM character-bible relationships section
      - Scene progression (exact sequence) → FROM story-synopsis (scene-by-scene) + beat-sheet
      - Visual style notes → FROM genre-analysis

      **CONSISTENCY CHECK**:
      - Screenplay scenes MUST match beat-sheet beats (all beats covered)
      - Screenplay pacing MUST match beat-sheet rhythm
      - Screenplay emotional arcs MUST match beat-sheet emotional mapping
      - Dialogue voices MUST match character-bible speech patterns
      - Genre tone MUST match genre-analysis recommendations

      **Combine previous outputs with Q1-Q15 answers to create screenplay.**

    outputs:
      - Project understanding
      - Character roster with voice profiles
      - Answers + context combined

  - step: 6
    name: "Scene Structure Planning (Based on Q1-Q10 Answers)"
    agent: screenplay-structure-writer
    collaboration:
      - master-story-director (structure oversight)
      - genre-specific-agent (genre conventions)

    action: |
      **Break story into scenes using Q1-Q10 answers:**

      **Scene Count determined by Q2 answer**:
      - Quick cuts (Q2) = 15-20 short scenes
      - Moderate = 10-15 scenes
      - Longer takes = 8-12 scenes

      For each scene identify:
      - Location (INT/EXT, specific place)
      - Time of day
      - Characters present
      - What happens (action beats from story)
      - Emotional tone (match Q9 emotional beat map)
      - Dialogue moments (who speaks, about what)
      - Scene purpose (plot/character/theme)
      - Estimated duration

      **Create scene flow**:
      - **Opening scene from story-synopsis.md STEP 11A**
      - Development scenes (build story from beat-sheet.md)
      - **Must-have scenes from Q5** (integrate specifically)
      - **Emotional beats from beat-sheet.md Q2/Q3** (place at right moments)
      - Climax scene (peak tension/emotion)
      - **Closing scene from story-synopsis.md STEP 11B**

      **Apply Q6 montages**:
      - Training montage (if requested)
      - Time passage (if requested)
      - Flashbacks (if requested)

      **Pacing from beat-sheet.md Q1**:
      - Fast-paced = minimal setup, jump to action
      - Building = slow start, accelerate to climax
      - Wave = peaks + valleys rhythm

      **SCENE-LEVEL SUBTEXT TRACKING (mandatory — every scene with 2+ characters):**

      Before writing each scene, read the relationship's entry in character-relations.md.

      For each scene ask:
      - THE UNSAID: Kya relationship ka unsaid moment felt hota hai? (not stated — felt through action/pause/deflection)
      - POWER DYNAMIC: Kaun lean kar raha hai, kaun pull away? Who speaks less?
      - WANT vs NEED: At least one character wants something they don't ask for directly?
      - SUBTEXT SIGNATURE: From character-relations.md — does it appear this act?

      Subtext Failure Patterns (flag and rewrite):
      ❌ STATED SUBTEXT: Characters say exactly what they feel (should be unspoken)
      ❌ SURFACE DIALOGUE: Characters only discuss events/logistics (no emotional undercurrent)
      ❌ EQUAL POWER: Both characters comfortable, nothing at stake between them
      ❌ MISSING SIGNATURE: Three scenes between same characters, signature never appears

      **PACING ARCHITECTURE MAP (create before writing scenes):**

      | Act | Scene Type | Pacing | Why |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | Act 1 Opening | Establish | Medium→Fast | Hook audience, establish world |
      | Act 1 End / Inciting Incident | Disruption | Fast | Sudden change must feel sudden |
      | Act 2 First Half | Exploration | Medium | Character in new situation |
      | Act 2 Midpoint | Turn | Fast | Midpoint raises stakes suddenly |
      | Act 2 Second Half | Escalation | Fast→Faster | Pressure building |
      | Pre-Climax | Lowest Point | SLOW | Dark night of the soul — must breathe |
      | Climax | Resolution | Fast → Slow | Action fast / emotional resolution slow |
      | Denouement | Landing | Slow | Audience needs to exhale |

      Pacing Rules:
      → THREE consecutive fast scenes = audience fatigue
      → THREE consecutive slow scenes = audience disengagement
      → After every emotional peak → one scene to breathe before next peak
      → Bollywood: slow down 2-3 scenes before interval, interval scene = emotional peak

      Verify:
      - All story beats covered
      - Q9 emotional beats placed correctly
      - Q8 must-have scenes included
      - Character arcs progress
      - Genre conventions honored

    outputs:
      - Complete scene breakdown (answer-based)
      - Q9 emotional beats mapped to scenes
      - Q8 must-haves integrated

      ✅ Detailed action lines (visual storytelling based on Q1)
      ✅ Character introductions (memorable first appearances)
      ✅ Scene descriptions and atmosphere
      ✅ Character behavior and movement
      ✅ PLACEHOLDER DIALOGUE (functional, shows flow and tone)

      **Apply Q1 (Dialogue vs Visual Balance)**:
      - Dialogue-heavy → Longer dialogue blocks, less action description
      - Visual-first → Detailed action lines, minimal dialogue
      - Balanced → Equal weight to both

      **Apply Q2 (Scene Length)**:
      - Quick cuts → Scenes 0.5-1 page each
      - Moderate → Scenes 1-3 pages
      - Longer takes → Scenes 3-5 pages

      **Apply Q3 (Subtext Level)**:
      - Direct → Placeholder dialogue says what it means
      - Heavy subtext → Placeholder shows tension, avoidance
      - Mark silences and beats

      **Apply Q4 (Transitions)**:
      - Hard cuts → Just scene heading, no bridge
      - Motivated → Link scenes with action/sound/theme
      - Time jumps → Add "LATER" / "DAYS LATER"

      For EACH scene write:

      **1. SCENE HEADING**:
      ```
      INT. LOCATION - TIME
      or
      EXT. LOCATION - TIME
      ```

      **2. SCENE ESTABLISHMENT** (opening lines):
      - Atmosphere and mood (genre-appropriate)
      - Location details that matter
      - Time/lighting feeling
      - Environmental sounds or energy
      - Sets visual tone

      **3. ACTION LINES** (what we see/hear):

      - Emotional states SHOWN (not told)
      - Important props/objects
      - Environment interactions
      - Short paragraphs (3-4 lines max - readable)

      **4. PLACEHOLDER DIALOGUE**:
      - Basic Hindi-English mix (from character profiles)
      - Shows information being conveyed
      - Shows emotional tone
      - Shows conversation flow
      - CHARACTER-APPROPRIATE (references character bible)
      - NOT final impactful lines (dialogue writer handles that)

      **GENRE-SPECIFIC STYLE**:
      Apply appropriate genre screenplay style:
      - Thriller: Tension in descriptions, observational details
      - Romance: Emotional atmosphere, character connection shown
      - Horror: Dread and unease, sensory details, what's NOT seen
      - Comedy: Setup/payoff structure, physical comedy opportunities
      - Action: Dynamic movement, clear geography, impact

      **RULES - DO NOT INCLUDE**:
      ❌ NO camera directions (no "CLOSE-UP", "WIDE SHOT")
      ❌ NO technical notes (lighting, sound, editing)
      ❌ NO shot breakdowns
      ❌ NO final polished dialogue (placeholder only)

      **ONLY WRITE**:

      ✅ Placeholder dialogue (functional)
      ✅ Scene flow and structure

      Keep it CLEAN and VISUAL. Structure foundation for dialogue.

      **Apply Language/Dialect** (from story-synopsis.md STEP 11D + character-bible.md):
      - Hindi-English ratio already set — apply per character from character-bible.md
      - Dialect/regional flavor already defined — apply from character-bible.md speech patterns
      - 60-70% Hindi (default) unless story-synopsis.md STEP 11D specifies otherwise

      **Apply Q7 (Formality)**:
      - Formal → "Aap" form, proper Hindi, educated vocabulary
      - Casual → "Tu/tum" form, street-smart mixing
      - Character-based → Different formality per person

      **Apply Q8 (Memorable Lines)**:
      - If user gave specific lines → Include EXACTLY as given
      - Craft dialoguebaazi moments at key scenes
      - One-liners, philosophical zingers, quotable lines

      **Apply Q9 (Dialogue Density)**:
      - Talky → Longer dialogue blocks, conversations
      - Balanced → Dialogue when needed, silence when powerful
      - Minimal → Terse lines, mark silences, Gulzar-style
      - Action-driven → Brief functional dialogue

      **Process**:

      1. **Read screenplay structure thoroughly**:
         - Note all placeholder dialogue
         - Understand scene emotional arcs
         - Identify character dynamics per scene
         - Track conversation power dynamics

      2. **Consult Character Bible for each character**:
         - Hindi-English ratio (e.g., 70% Hindi, 30% English)
         - Vocabulary level (educated/simple/technical)
         - Speech rhythm (fast/slow/interrupted)
         - Verbal tics (repeated phrases)
         - Emotional expression style
         - Background (class, education, region)

      3. **Apply Genre Dialogue Style**:
         - **Thriller**: Terse, subtext-heavy, tension in casual talk
         - **Romance**: Emotional, expressive, vulnerability shown
         - **Horror**: Believable fear, fragmented under terror
         - **Comedy**: Wit, timing, absurd logic, rapid-fire
         - **Action**: Short punchy lines, one-liners, urgency

      4. **Apply Language/Dialect** (user-specified or default):
         - Default: Simple Bollywood Hindi (60-70% Hindi, 30-40% English)
         - Natural code-switching (tech/modern = English, emotions = Hindi)
         - If dialect specified (Haryanvi/Bihari/etc): Apply consistently
         - Balance authenticity with accessibility

      5. **Write Final Dialogue**:
         - Each character sounds DISTINCT (identify speaker without name)
         - Actable (sounds natural when spoken aloud)
         - Has subtext (what's unsaid matters)
         - Reveals character (not just information)
         - Moves story or deepens character
         - Fits emotional tone of scene
         - Create memorable moments (quotable lines where appropriate)

      6. **Quality Check**:
         - Read aloud test (must sound natural)
         - Character voice consistency check
         - No on-the-nose exposition
         - Subtext present
         - Genre tone maintained
         - Language specification followed

      **BOLLYWOOD DIALOGUE QUALITY**:
      - Impactful, not flat
      - Memorable lines (audiences remember dialogue)
      - Character-specific voices
      - Natural speech (not literary)
      - Emotional authenticity
      - Cultural authenticity

    quality_standards: |
      Every dialogue must meet:

      ✓ **Distinct**: Can identify speaker without seeing name
      ✓ **Natural**: Sounds real when spoken aloud
      ✓ **Layered**: Has subtext, what's unsaid matters
      ✓ **Genre-appropriate**: Matches thriller/romance/horror/comedy/action style
      ✓ **Language-accurate**: Follows Hindi-English ratio from character bible
      ✓ **Dialect-consistent**: If specified, applied throughout
      ✓ **Actable**: Actor can deliver with emotion
      ✓ **Impactful**: Bollywood quality, memorable where appropriate
      ✓ **No exposition dumps**: Information conveyed naturally

      **DIALOGUE QUOTABILITY AUDIT (run after full dialogue pass):**

      *Har badi Bollywood film mein 3-5 lines hoti hain jo log saalon tak bolte hain.*

      Quotability Criteria (a line is quotable if it meets 3+):
      1. Specific enough to feel real (not generic)
      2. Universal enough that anyone can see themselves in it
      3. Surprising word choice (expected thing, unexpected way)
      4. Standalone: makes sense without film context
      5. Emotionally charged: feeling in the words themselves
      6. Rhythmic: sounds good when said aloud

      Process:
      → Extract 10 most important lines from the screenplay
      → Apply criteria to each — lines scoring 2 or below = rewrite candidate
      → Target: 3-5 quotable lines per feature | 1-2 per web series episode

      Quotability Rewrite Technique (for low-scoring important lines):
      Take the meaning → strip obvious phrasing → find unexpected way to say it
      Obvious: "Main tumse bahut pyaar karta hoon"
      Better: "Aaj bhi chaai teri taraf se banata hoon — teri cup alag rakhta hoon"
      → Same meaning → unexpected specificity → quotable

      Show to writer: "Yeh hain confirmed quotable lines jo is film ko define karengi: [list 3-5]"

    outputs:
      - Complete screenplay with final dialogue
      - All placeholder dialogue replaced
      - Character voices distinct and consistent
      - Genre-appropriate dialogue style
      - Language/dialect authenticity
      - Bollywood-quality memorable lines

    agent: dialogue-writer

    action: |
      **Verify final screenplay format and length (answers applied):**

      **Format Check**:
      - Scene headings proper (INT/EXT, LOCATION - TIME)
      - Action lines present tense, visual, short paragraphs
      - Dialogue formatted correctly (character name, dialogue)
      - Character names CAPS on first mention
      - Proper spacing and readability
      - NO technical notes (verify clean)

      **Length Verification**:
      - Count pages (1 page ≈ 1 minute)
      - Target: [X] pages for [X]-minute film
      - If over/under by more than 10%:
        * Identify scenes to trim/expand
        * Adjust dialogue length (not content)
        * Maintain all story beats

      **Readability Check**:
      - Flows smoothly scene to scene
      - Easy to visualize
      - Easy to read aloud
      - Professional appearance

      **Language Check**:
      - Consistent Hindi-English ratios per character
      - Dialect (if specified) consistent throughout
      - Natural code-switching (not forced)
      - Accessible to target audience

      **VISUAL vs DIALOGUE BALANCE AUDIT:**

      Categorize every scene: Dialogue-Heavy (70%+ dialogue) / Visual (70%+ action) / Balanced

      Healthy Ratios by Genre:
      | Genre | Dialogue-Heavy | Visual | Balanced |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | Drama | 40-50% | 20-30% | 30-40% |
      | Thriller/Action | 20-30% | 40-50% | 30-40% |
      | Romance | 35-45% | 25-35% | 30-40% |
      | Comedy | 40-50% | 20-30% | 30-40% |
      | Social Cinema | 35-45% | 25-35% | 30-40% |

      Imbalance Flags:
      ❌ 60%+ scenes Dialogue-Heavy: "Yeh radio play lag raha hai, film nahi"
         → Identify 3 scenes that could be converted to visual storytelling
      ❌ 5+ consecutive same-pacing scenes: rhythm broken → vary texture
      ❌ Visual-only if NOT intentional: verify selected framework was Visual-Forward

      Show to writer (brief): "Balance check: [X]% dialogue / [Y]% visual / [Z]% balanced → [PASS / FLAG]"

    outputs:
      - Formatted screenplay
      - Length verified and adjusted

  2. Character Bible ✅
  3. Beat Sheet ✅
  4. Screenplay ⬅️ (This step)

  BOLLYWOOD TWO-AGENT MODEL (Authentic Industry Practice):

  **Agent 1: Screenplay Structure Writer**
  - Creates visual foundation
  - Scene construction, action lines
  - Placeholder dialogue (functional)
  - Genre-trained for appropriate style

  **Agent 2: Dialogue Writer (Samvad Lekhak)**
  - Crafts final impactful dialogue
  - Character-specific voices
  - Genre-appropriate style
  - Language/dialect expertise

  This separation mirrors Bollywood tradition:
  - "Screenplay: [Name]"
  - "Dialogues: [Name]"

  Benefits:
  - Better specialization (dialogue is an art)
  - Genre-trained agents for both structure and dialogue
  - Dialogue quality matches Bollywood standards
  - Character voices more distinct
  - More control over final product

  Language/Dialect Options:
  - Default: Simple Bollywood Hindi (60-70% Hindi, 30-40% English)
  - Pure Hindi (90% Hindi, formal/literary)
  - Hinglish (50-50, urban youth)
  - Regional dialects: Haryanvi, Bihari, Marathi-influenced, Punjabi-influenced

  Technical specifications come LATER from:
  - Cinematographer (camera, shots)
  - Gaffer (lighting)
  - Sound Designer (sound)
  - Editor (cutting)

  Screenplay = STORY in visual form with powerful dialogue
  NOT = Production manual
