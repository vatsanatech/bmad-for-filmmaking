# 🔴 AUTO-TRIGGER RULE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Triggers when:
# - User selects "Web Series" or "Limited Series" in STEP 0 format selection
# - User says "web series banao", "multi-episode series", "OTT series"
# - Any request for multi-episode story content (not micro drama)

  **WEB SERIES DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM** — Two-level architecture.

  Level 1 (Season): Runs ONCE before any episode work.
  Creates the master documents that ALL episodes must follow.

  Level 2 (Episode): Runs PER EPISODE after season documents approved.
  Each episode has its own synopsis, beat-sheet, screenplay, shot-breakdown.

  **8 Story Elements — How Series Treats Each:**

  CHARACTER: Transformation is SLOW — audiences spend 10+ hours, every change must be earned.
  Each episode reveals ONE new layer. Full arc visible only at season end.

  RELATIONSHIP: Multiple relationships evolving simultaneously. The WEB between all
  characters IS the season arc. Which relationship the episode focuses on = what the episode is about.

  EMOTION: Episode-level peaks + season-level crescendo. Audience must feel something
  at end of EVERY episode. Season finale delivers the accumulated emotional payoff.

  PLOT: Two levels — Season Plot (what's the big story?) + Episode Plot (what happens this episode?).
  Multiple threads running simultaneously. Not all resolve each episode.

  WORLD: World-building is a FEATURE. Rules revealed gradually across episodes.
  World has its own secrets that take full season to surface.

  CONFLICT: External conflict spans the season. Internal conflict evolves — same wound,
  different pressure in each episode.

  THEME: One theme, explored from multiple angles across episodes. Different episodes
  reveal different facets of the same truth.

  SUBTEXT: Lives in the relationship web. Each episode has its own subtext layer AND
  contributes to the season-level unsaid.

      ```
      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      📍 STEP 0 of 12 — Series Format + Concept Intake
      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      ```

      **Series Format Questions:**

      SF1. "Kitne episodes soch rahe ho? (4 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 13 / doosra number)"
      SF2. "Ek episode kitna lamba hoga? (20-30 min / 40-50 min / 60+ min)"
      SF3. "Platform kaun sa? (OTT like Netflix/Hotstar / YouTube / Television / doosra)"
      SF4. "Season structure kya ho? (Ek continuous story / Har episode thoda self-contained / Half season break)"

      **CONCEPT MINING (Before Seeds — Mandatory):**
      Writer ke concept mein se 3-5 threads nikalo. Jo unhone kaha — literally unke words use karo.
      "Tumne [X] kaha — yeh interesting hai. Aur [Y] mention kiya. Aur [Z] bhi tha..."
      Tab seeds shuru karo.

      **40/60 MODEL: Writer 16 deep seeds deta hai (12 core + 4 series-specific).**
      **AI 60% season architecture un seeds se banata hai.**
      Ek seed at a time. Main Q → jawab lo → Depth Probe → jawab lo → next seed.
      Depth Probe skip karna FORBIDDEN. DNA chahiye — surface answer nahi.

      **GROUP 1 — WHY + CORE (S1–S4)**

      S1. KHINCHAV (Personal Origin)
          Main Q: "Yeh series kab se hai tumhare andar? Puri season ki kahani —
          kya cheez baar baar kheenchti hai is taraf?"
          Depth Probe: "Woh exact moment kya tha jab yeh series pehli baar aayi —
          koi cheez dekhi, suni, ya mehsoos ki? Real zindagi mein kuch connected hai kya?"

      S2. PEHLI IMAGE — EPISODE 1 (Visual DNA)
          Main Q: "Aankhein band karo. Is series ka woh ek image jo tumhe nahi chhodta —
          EPISODE 1 KA. Describe karo exactly."
          Depth Probe: "Us frame mein light kahan se aa rahi hai — andhera zyada ya roshni?
          Aur koi sound hai usme — ya bilkul khamosh hai?"

      S3. AAKHRI EHSAAS — SEASON FINALE (Emotional Destination)
          Main Q: "Season finale khatam hoti hai. Audience sofa pe baithe hain —
          exactly kya feel ho raha hai unhe?"
          Depth Probe: "Yeh feeling — tumhari khud ki zindagi mein kisi cheez se connected hai?
          Koi baar tumhe yeh exact feeling aayi thi?"

      S4. JO KEHNA MUSHKIL HAI (Core Season Truth)
          Main Q: "Is puri season mein koi dark ya uncomfortable truth hai jo kehna zaroori hai?"
          Depth Probe: "Agar tum yeh nahi kehte is series mein — season kya missing ho jaayega?
          Exactly woh kya hai jo sirf yeh series keh sakti hai?"

      **GROUP 2 — WHO + RELATIONSHIP (S5–S8)**

      S5. CHAHNA AUR ZAROORAT (Character Psychology)
          Main Q: "Tumhara main character kya CHAHTA hai — jo dikhta hai?
          Aur unhe kya ZAROORI hai — jo unhe khud bhi pata nahi?"
          Depth Probe: "Woh 'zaroori' cheez — kab se hai unke andar? Koi ek moment
          jab woh need shuru hui. Aur yeh wound is season mein KAUNSE episode mein surface pe aata hai?"

      S6. SEASON KA BACKBONE RISHTA (Core Relationship)
          Main Q: "Is puri season ka backbone kaun sa rishta hai —
          woh do log jinke beech poori season ki engine chalti hai?"
          Depth Probe: "Yeh rishta season ke shuru mein kahan hai — aur season ke end mein kahan hoga?
          Ek cheez batao jo in dono ne kabhi same direction mein nahi dekhi."

      S7. JO KABHI NAHI KAHA GAYA — SEASON LEVEL (Subtext Engine)
          Main Q: "Un dono ke beech woh unsaid cheez kya hai jo poori season mein
          hawa mein rehti hai — har episode mein?"
          Depth Probe: "Yeh unsaid cheez — season finale mein kahi jaayegi ya phir bhi nahi?
          Agar kahi gayi — toh agle season ka kya? Ya series khatam?"

      S8. WOH EK TURNING POINT (Season Spine)
          Main Q: "Season ka woh ek moment — sirf ek — jo sab kuch permanently badal deta hai.
          Kya hai woh?"
          Depth Probe: "Yeh turning point kaunse episode mein hai — shuru mein, beech mein, ya finale mein?
          Protagonist akela hai ya saath? Kaunsi cheez dekh, sun, ya feel karke yeh happen karta hai?"

      **GROUP 3 — LANDING + TONE (S9–S12)**

      S9. SEASON FINALE IMAGE (Resolution)
          Main Q: "Season finale ka last scene — ek image. Kaun hai frame mein, kya ho raha hai?"
          Depth Probe: "Episode 1 ki pehli image (S2) se yeh last image kaise different hai?
          Season mein kya badla — woh difference is image mein kaise dikhta hai?"

      S10. FEEL REFERENCE (Hyper-Specific Tone)
          Main Q: "Koi ek series ya film jis ki FEEL tumhari series se milti hai —
          story nahi, sirf feel."
          Depth Probe: "Us series ka ek specific scene jo us feel ko best represent karta hai —
          woh 2-3 minute ka scene describe karo."

      S11. JO BILKUL NAHI CHAHIYE (Anti-Cliché Guard)
          Main Q: "Ek cheez jo is series mein tum definitely NAHI chahte —
          koi cliché, koi trope, koi familiar pattern."
          Depth Probe: "Agar woh cheez accidentally aa jaaye — audience ko exactly kya feel hoga
          jo tum NAHI chahte? Woh feeling batao."

      S12. OUT OF THE BOX + SEASON SUBTEXT (Originality Layer)
          Main Q: "Kuch aisa jo typically is genre ki series mein nahi hota +
          ek cheez jo poori season mein kabhi directly nahi kahi jaayegi par neeche behti rahegi."
          Depth Probe: "Woh 'out of box' element kahan se aaya — koi real cheez, koi memory?
          Aur audience ne poori season dekhi — woh ek sentence mein kya samjhe jo season ne nahi kaha?"

      **SERIES ENGINE QUESTION (MANDATORY — most critical web series question):**

      Before seeds S13-S16, ask this first:

      ENGINE Q: "Is series ka 'engine' kya hai — woh ek cheez jo Season 1 khatam hone tak
      naturally naya conflict deti rahegi, bina force kiye?
      (Not a plot — a MECHANISM. Example: 'City officer meets rural bureaucracy' — har episode mein
      naturally nayi clash. Ya 'Criminal power vacuum + multiple claimants' — har episode mein koi
      naya threat ya move.)"

      Depth Probe: "Is engine se 8 episodes naturally nikal sakte hain? Ya sirf 2-3?
      Agar sirf 2-3 → Engine weak hai → Redesign karo with writer before continuing."

      ENGINE TEST (run internally): Does this engine naturally produce conflict WITHOUT the writer
      having to force external events? YES → Strong. NO → Weak — probe further.

      **GROUP 4 — SERIES-SPECIFIC SEEDS (S13–S16)**

      S13. SEASON QUESTION (Thematic Core)
          Main Q: "Is puri season mein ek bada thematic sawaal hai —
          jo season ke end mein explore hota hai. Woh kaunsa sawaal hai?
          (Plot sawaal nahi — insaani sawaal. Jaise: 'Kya ek insaan sachchi tabdili la sakta hai?')"
          Depth Probe: "Finale mein yeh sawaal answer hota hai — ya deliberately open rehta hai?
          Agar answer hota hai — kya hai woh answer?"

      S14. WORLD TRANSFORMATION (Season Arc)
          Main Q: "Season ke shuru mein duniya ka ek state hai —
          season ke end mein woh state badal gayi hai. Woh transformation kya hai?"
          Depth Probe: "Is transformation ka woh irreversible moment kaunsa hai —
          jo season mein ek baar hota hai aur kuch pehle jaisa nahi rehta?"

      S15. EPISODE HOOK DNA (Binge Engine)
          Main Q: "Har episode ke end mein audience ko kheenchne wala hook
          kis type ka hoga — mystery? emotional cliffhanger? action? character revelation?"
          Depth Probe: "Woh hook type kya feel deta hai audience ko —
          excited? anxious? curious? heartbroken? — Exactly woh feeling batao."

      S16. PLATFORM + FORMAT ANCHOR
          Main Q: "Kitne episodes? Ek episode kitna lamba? Platform kaun sa?"
          Depth Probe: "Is platform pe audience kis mood mein watch karta hai —
          commute pe? raat ko? binge session mein?
          Yeh pace aur episode length decide karta hai."

      **MANDATORY RULES:**
      1. Concept Mining PEHLE — seeds baad mein
      2. Depth Probe MANDATORY har seed ke baad — skip strictly forbidden
      3. Ek seed at a time — Main Q + Probe + phir next seed
      4. Koi option mat do — khule sawal only
      5. S13-S16 bhi same depth probe pattern follow karo

      ```

      **PURPOSE: Writer ke 16 seeds se AI puri SEASON architecture propose karta hai.**

      **STEP 1: PASS 0 — SEED TRACEABILITY (run internally before showing user)**
      Har proposed element ke liye check karo: "Yeh kaunse seed se aaya?"

      Seed → What it drives at SEASON level:
      - S1 (khinchav + real origin) → Series' emotional reason + creator's personal investment
      - S2 (Episode 1 image + light/sound) → Visual grammar for series opening, world tone
      - S3 (finale feeling + personal connect) → Season-end emotional payoff
      - S4 (uncomfortable truth + what's missing) → Season's thematic core
      - S5 (want/need + wound + episode surface) → Protagonist psychology + arc episode
      - S6 (backbone rishta + season journey + divergence) → Season relationship architecture
      - S7 (unsaid + said/not-said + next season) → Subtext engine across all episodes
      - S8 (turning point + episode + sensory) → Season structural spine, midpoint
      - S9 (finale image + S2 contrast) → Full season arc, transformation proof
      - S10 (feel reference + specific scene) → Series tone, pacing, episode rhythm
      - S11 (what not to have + feeling to avoid) → Anti-pattern map, rejection reasoning
      - S12 (unexpected element + subtext sentence) → Originality layer, series' hidden current
      - S13 (season question + finale answer) → Thematic architecture
      - S14 (world transformation + irreversible moment) → Season world arc
      - S15 (hook type + hook feeling) → Episode-to-episode engine
      - S16 (platform + watch mood) → Pacing, episode length, hook intensity

      RULE: Koi bhi proposed element bina seed se trace kiye nahi rahega.
            Agar trace nahi hota → AI generic default hai → HATA DO.

      **STEP 2: GENERATE SEASON ARCHITECTURE — then USER KO DIKHAO:**

      📍 AI SEASON ARCHITECTURE PROPOSAL
      Tumhare 16 seeds se main yeh series architecture propose kar raha hoon:

    agent: "master-story-director"
    action: |
      **PURPOSE: Writer reacts to AI proposal. Yeh writer ka 40% hai — generating nahi, calibrating.**

      Quick aur targeted reactions collect karo. Har reaction architecture refines karta hai.

      **REACTION RULES:**
      - "Theek hai" → lock it, next element
      - "Wrong direction" → probe once: "Woh kya hoga toh?" → note → adjust
      - "Change karna hai" → "Exactly kya change?" → note → adjust
      - "Nahi samjha" → rephrase using writer's own seed words
      - After all reactions: synthesize CONFIRMED season architecture

      **AFTER ALL REACTIONS — SYNTHESIZE + CONFIRM:**

      ```
      Theek hai! Confirmed season architecture:

      ✓ Genre: [final]
      ✓ Protagonist psychology + wound + episode surface: [final — seed + calibration]
      ✓ Season backbone relationship (start → end): [final]
      ✓ The unsaid (said/not-said in finale): [final]
      ✓ World + season arc (start → irreversible moment → end): [final]
      ✓ Season structural spine (Ep 1 → midpoint → finale): [final]
      ✓ Subtext + tone: [final]
      ✓ Episode hook engine: [final]
      ✓ What to avoid: [final]

      Sab confirm hai? Ab genre specialist ko brief karta hoon — Season Bible shuru hogi.

      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      📍 STEP 1 of 12 — Genre Analysis + Season Story Structure
      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      ```

      Apply standard genre identification (master-story-director.md decision tree).
      Select genre specialist.

      Then ask season-structure questions:

      **Story Structure for Series:**
      - How does the season arc work? (Linear season / Multiple arcs / Anthology eps)
      - Where is the mid-season turning point (if applicable)?
      - What is the season finale's emotional payoff?
      - Is there a second season possibility? (affects how much to resolve)

      **🔴 6 SEASON ELEMENT PROCESSING PASSES (MANDATORY — Run in order):**
      (PASS 0 runs FIRST — before all others. Then PASS 1-5 in order.)

      **PASS 0 — SEED TRACEABILITY FINAL CHECK (Run FIRST):**
      Season architecture ka final version confirm karne se pehle — har element trace karo:
      - Protagonist wound/psychology → S5 depth probe? Agar nahi → REWRITE from seed
      - Season backbone relationship → S6 + S7 unspeakable? Agar nahi → REWRITE
      - World opening + tone → S2 depth probe (light/sound)? Agar nahi → REWRITE
      - Season turning point → S8 depth probe (episode + sensory)? Agar nahi → REWRITE
      - Finale image + feeling → S9 + S3? Agar nahi → REWRITE
      - Season subtext current → S12 subtext sentence? Agar nahi → REWRITE
      - Thematic question + answer → S13 depth probe? Agar nahi → REWRITE
      ZERO TOLERANCE: Koi bhi untraced element = generic AI default = hatao.

      **PASS 1 — ANTI-PATTERN FILTER (OUTPUT TO USER — MANDATORY):**
      Is series ki 3 sabse predictable versions internally identify karo.
      Phir inhe USER KO DIKHAO — Season Bible likhne se PEHLE. Yeh step skip nahi hoga.

      **USER KO DIKHAO (MANDATORY FORMAT):**
      ```
      Is series ke teen sabse predictable versions jo main NAHI likh raha:

      ❌ Version 1: [Generic series version — 1-2 lines, writer ke genre/concept se related]
      ❌ Version 2: [Generic version — alag angle se, familiar pattern]
      ❌ Version 3: [Generic version — ek aur common series trap]

      Yeh teeno avoid kiye gaye hain. Ab 4th version ki Season Bible likh raha hoon.
      ```

      **PASS 2 — ELEMENT BALANCE (Relationship Web as Season Engine):**
      Kya SEASON PLOT drive kar raha hai ya RELATIONSHIP WEB?
      → Har major plot point: "Yeh kisi relationship dynamic se kyun emerge ho raha hai?"
      → Subtext layer: Jo kaha jaata hai + Jo nahi kaha jaata + Jo chahte hain = teeno alag

      **PASS 3 — SPECIFICITY DRILL (Generic → Series-Grade Cinematic):**
      Season elements ko hyper-specific banao:
      - Generic world → Ek specific detail only THIS series ke world mein hai (S12a)
      - Generic conflict → Exact moment, exact episode, exact word ya silence
      - Generic characters → S5 contradiction + S6 divergence + S7 unspeakable
      Test: "Kya yeh season kisi doosri series mein copy ho sakti hai?" → Yes = aur specific karo

      **PASS 4 — EMOTIONAL SUBVERSION (Season-Level):**
      Season arc mein: audience EXPECTS kya feel karna? → Deliver unexpected version (earned):
      - Expected: Hero triumphant finale → Deliver: Win + irreversible loss (S14 irreversible moment)
      - Expected: Relationship resolution → Deliver: Understanding without resolution
      Goal: Season ke end mein audience ko ek unexpected emotional dhakka — jo SAHI bhi lage

      **PASS 5 — "ONLY THIS SERIES" TEST:**
      Har season beat: "Kya yeh exact moment kisi aur show mein alag characters ke saath ho sakta tha?"
      Agar YES → Rewrite until it couldn't happen in any other series.
      S6 relationship DNA + S8 turning point specificity + S13 thematic question = irreplaceable season.

      **PASS 6 — STAGE QA SCORE (Internal — run before Season Bible is written):**
      Target: 70+ to proceed. Score each parameter internally.

      STORY & CONCEPT      /25 → Originality + Season Hook (pilot grabs?) + Theme (organic) + Mudda presence + Platform/audience fit
      STRUCTURE           /20 → Pilot engineering + Pacing across season + Midseason Shock strength + Finale earn
      CHARACTERS          /15 → Protagonist season arc clarity + Character world depth + All major arcs mapped
      DIALOGUES           /15 → Authenticity (natural speech) + Memorable episode lines + Season-level subtext
      EMOTIONAL ENGAGEMENT /10 → Season emotional core + Unseen Emotion (emotion rarely shown across the season)
      BINGE FACTOR        /10 → Cliffhanger variety (4 types) + Episode hook engine consistency
      PRODUCTION FEASIBILITY /5 → Story stays within selected budget tier + Platform format match

      STAGE SCORE GATE:
      → 85-100 (A+): Premium — Season Bible likhna shuru karo
      → 75-84  (A) : Quality — proceed
      → 65-74  (B+): Fix flagged areas before writing Season Bible
      → Below 65   : Return to seeds — season concept needs rethink

      CRITICAL FLAGS (fail immediately if any present):
      ❌ Mudda missing: Season explores no unexplored social/human truth → feels generic
      ❌ Series Engine weak: Engine naturally produces <4 episodes of conflict → redesign
      ❌ Pilot hook absent: Episode 1 plants no season question → audience won't continue
      ❌ Unseen emotion absent: All emotions across season are predictable → forgettable series

      **DIVERGE BEFORE CONVERGE (MANDATORY — before Season Bible is written):**

      3 genuinely different season directions writer ke OWN seeds se:

      ```
      Tumhare seeds mein teen alag season directions dikh rahi hain:

      🔵 Direction A — [Season direction — from S2/S9 images + S14 world arc]
         [Writer's specific seed that generates this direction]
         Season Feel: [Dark/Expansive/Intimate — 1-2 words]

      🟡 Direction B — [Season direction — from S6/S7 relationship + S13 question]
         [Writer's specific seed that generates this direction]
         Season Feel: [1-2 words]

      🔴 Direction C — [Season direction — from S12 subtext + S4 truth]
         [Writer's specific seed that generates this direction]
         Season Feel: [1-2 words]

      Kaunsa season sabse tumhara lagta hai?
      Ya koi do directions combine karna chahte ho?
      ```

      Lock direction. Tab Season Bible shuru karo.

      **Answer at Finale:** [How/whether it gets answered]

      ---

      ## WORLD RULES
      *Jo cheezein poori season mein consistent rehti hain — kabhi nahi badlati.*

      **Season End State:** [State of the world at finale]
      **The Irreversible Moment:** [One moment that permanently changes the world]

      ---

      ## SEASON SUBTEXT
      *Jo kabhi directly nahi kaha jaayega lekin poori season mein behta rahega.*

      **The Unsaid:** [What the season is actually about beneath its plot]
      **How it surfaces:** [Which episodes it comes closest to being said]
      **Final episode:** [Does it get said? Or remains unsaid forever?]

      ## THREE-LEVEL CONFLICT ARCHITECTURE
      *Teen levels pe conflict simultaneously track karo — yeh web series ko film se alag karta hai.*

      **LEVEL 1 — EPISODIC CONFLICT** (resolves each episode):
      | Episode | Conflict | Resolution Type | Residue Left for Next |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | Ep 01 | [This episode's specific problem] | [Resolved/Partial/Open] | [What carries forward] |
      | Ep 02 | ... | ... | ... |
      | ... | | | |

      **LEVEL 2 — SEASON ARC CONFLICT** (resolves at finale):
      **The Season Conflict:** [One sentence — the overarching problem of the whole season]
      **Established at:** Episode [X]
      **Major escalation at:** Episode [X] (Midseason Shock)
      **Resolves at:** Finale
      **How:** [Resolution type — full/partial/bittersweet]

      **LEVEL 3 — SERIES CONFLICT** (NEVER resolves — would end the series):
      **The Permanent Tension:** [The fundamental tension that outlasts every season]
      **Why it can't resolve:** [If it did, the series would have no more stories to tell]
      **How Season 1 touches it:** [Which episode brings it closest]
      **Seasons 2, 3...:** [How this tension will continue to generate stories]

      ---

      ## MIDSEASON SHOCK — EPISODE 4-5
      *Woh revelation jo POORI STORY recontextualize kare — aur social media conversation drive kare.*

      **Shock Episode:** Episode [4 or 5]
      **What is revealed:** [The revelation — must recontextualize Episodes 1-3]
      **Recontextualization test:** After this reveal, audience Episode 1-3 alag dekhenge — HOW?
      → [Specific: "Scene X mein jo [character] ne kaha tha woh ab [new meaning] hai"]
      **Audience reaction target:** [What we want audience to post/discuss after this episode]

      ---

      ## MID-SEASON DROP ENGINEERING

      *Midseason shock ek event nahi hai — ek engineered 3-episode experience hai.*

      **THE THREE-EPISODE BLOCK:**

      ### EPISODE BEFORE SHOCK — THE FALSE SECURITY EPISODE:
      *Audience ko yeh sochna chahiye ki sab theek ho raha hai — TABHI shock zyada lagti hai.*

      Design requirements for the pre-shock episode:
      → A-Story: Small win or resolution — protagonist something achieves
      → Relationship: Core relationship at its MOST comfortable/close point
      → Tone: Lightest episode of the series — comedy or warmth allowed
      → Audience state going in: "Yeh toh sahi direction mein ja raha hai"
      → What the audience must NOT suspect: [the shock coming]

      **RULE:** The false security episode is the most deceptive episode to write. It must feel genuine, not hollow. If it feels like setup, the shock will not land.

      ### THE SHOCK EPISODE — MIDSEASON SHOCK:
      (This already exists in your Season Bible — add only these engineering notes)

      → The shock MUST happen within first 15 minutes of the episode (not at the end — let it breathe)
      → Rest of shock episode = characters (and audience) processing what just happened
      → No plot advancement in the shock episode after the shock — only emotional processing
      → Last scene of shock episode: one character alone, the weight of the new reality visible

      ### EPISODE AFTER SHOCK — THE RE-ORIENTATION EPISODE:
      *Audience bhi shocked hai — unhe naya normal samajhne ka waqt chahiye.*

      Design requirements for the post-shock episode:
      → Open with the immediate aftermath — no time jump, no skip
      → Each character reaction to the shock (they all react differently — based on character-bible)
      → One character reaction surprises everyone (audience included)
      → New status quo established — what is the new normal now?
      → A-Story of this episode: navigating the new reality
      → End of this episode: audience accepts new reality AND wants to see what happens next

      **THREE-EPISODE BLOCK CHECKLIST (show to user before writing these episodes):**
      1. Pre-shock episode delivers false security? YES/NO
      2. Shock happens in first 15 min of shock episode? YES/NO
      3. Post-shock episode shows immediate aftermath (no time jump)? YES/NO
      4. Each major character reacts to shock differently? YES/NO
      5. New status quo clear by end of post-shock episode? YES/NO

      ## SEASON 2 SEEDS
      *Season 1 finishes aur Season 2 ke liye 3 seeds plant karta hai.*

      RULE: Season 1 Finale = 70% resolution + 30% new questions.

      **Seed 1 — Character Arc Left Open:**
      [Which character starts a journey in Season 1 but doesn't complete it]
      [What will Season 2 continue for them]

      **Seed 2 — World Secret Introduced:**
      [What the audience KNOWS exists but hasn't fully seen in Season 1]
      [What Season 2 will reveal about it]

      **Seed 3 — Relationship Turning Point:**
      [Which relationship reached a major turning point in Season 1 but not resolution]
      [Where it could go in Season 2]

      HARD RULE: If Season 1 answers EVERYTHING → No Season 2 possible → Revise finale.

      1. SERIES ENGINE ACTIVE: Kya written story mein engine clearly visible hai?
         → [Engine S-seed answer se directly story generate ho rahi hai? ✅ / ⚠️ + fix]

      2. THREE-LEVEL CONFLICT: Teeno levels present hain season synopsis mein?
         → [Level 1 episode-level: ✅/⚠️ | Level 2 season-arc: ✅/⚠️ | Level 3 series: ✅/⚠️]

      3. MIDSEASON SHOCK: Episode 4-5 ka shock genuinely recontextualizes earlier story?
         → [✅ Does recontextualize Episodes 1-3 / ⚠️ Too mild — suggest escalation]

      4. SEASON 2 SEEDS: Season 1 finale 70% resolves + 30% new questions plants?
         → [✅ Seeds visible / ⚠️ Finale too closed or too open]

      5. BOTTLE EPISODE VISIBLE: Intimate character moments planned?
         → [✅ / ⚠️ All episodes are plot-heavy — add a breathing episode]

      6. HINDI QUALITY: Language standards maintained?

      7. MUDDA (Unexplored Season Issue)
         Kya puri season mein koi aisa social/human topic hai jo screen pe pehle rarely explore hua?
         → [✅ Mudda: "[what the issue is]" — runs through Season arc / ⚠️ Missing — season lacks depth]

      8. UNSEEN EMOTION
         Kya season mein koi aisa emotion hai jo screen pe normally rarely dikhta hai?
         → [✅ Yes — "[emotion]" surfaces at Episode X unexpectedly / ⚠️ All emotions are standard]

      9. AUDIENCE MIRROR
         Kya audience apni khud ki zindagi characters ki season-long journey mein dekh sakta hai?
         → [✅ Yes — relatable across multiple episodes / ⚠️ Journey too distant from lived experience]

      10. GROUP EMOTION MOMENT
          Kya season mein ek aisa scene hai jab poore audience ek hi cheez feel kare saath mein?
          → [✅ Episode X Scene Y creates collective emotion / ⚠️ No group-emotion peak in season]

      11. ASPIRATIONAL ELEMENT
          Kya season mein koi "dream come true" ya inspiring moment hai jo audience ko uthake jaaye?
          → [✅ Present at Episode X / ⚠️ Season is all struggle — no hope, aspiration, or payoff]

      **A-Story:** [Complete episode story]
      **B-Story:** [Season arc thread advanced]
      **Core Relationship This Episode:** [Which pair + what dynamic explored]
      **Key Dialogue Moment:** [One scene that carries the episode's subtext]
      **Episode Climax:** [What happens]
      **Emotional Button:** [How audience feels at end]
      **Hook to Episode 02:** [What pulls them to next episode]

      [Repeat for all episodes]
      ```

      **BOTTLE EPISODE PLANNING (1-2 per season — mandatory):**

      Bottle Episode = Ek episode jahan:
      - Season arc temporarily pauses
      - Sirf 1-2 characters ka intimate scene
      - Koi naya plot information nahi
      - Par DEEP character revelation
      - Audience yeh episode sabse zyada quote karte hain

      Designate during Episode Map:
      **Bottle Episode 1:** Episode [3 or 4] — [Which 2 characters] — [What they talk about that's never been said]
      **Bottle Episode 2:** Episode [7] — [Pre-finale relief — which relationship] — [The conversation before everything changes]

      RULE: "Kaunse episode mein hum plot bhool jaayein aur sirf do characters ko ek room mein rakhein?
      Woh conversation kya hogi?" — Answer this for each bottle episode.

      ## PILOT ENGINEERING *(Episode 1 only — mandatory pre-write checklist)*

      *Pilot baaki episodes se alag hota hai. Isko engineer karna padta hai.*

      **A pilot must do 5 things in 1 episode — verify ALL before writing Episode 1:**

      **PILOT REQUIREMENT 1 — WORLD ESTABLISHMENT (first 10 minutes):**
      → Audience ko is duniya ke RULES samajh aane chahiye
      → What is normal in this world? (before everything breaks)
      → One establishing scene that SHOWS the world without explaining it

      **PILOT REQUIREMENT 2 — CHARACTER INTRODUCTION (first 15 minutes):**
      → ALL major characters introduced (not necessarily in depth — but seen)
      → Protagonist WANT established clearly (even if need is hidden)
      → Protagonist wound hinted at (not explained — just felt)

      **PILOT REQUIREMENT 3 — SEASON QUESTION PLANTED:**
      → The one question the whole season is trying to answer — must be visible by episode end
      → Not answered — only ASKED clearly enough that audience wants the answer
      → Example: Pilot ends and audience is asking [The Season Question] — that is correct

      **PILOT REQUIREMENT 4 — EPISODE EMOTIONAL HOOK (last 5 minutes):**
      → Episode 1 has its own complete emotional moment (not just a cliffhanger)
      → Audience feels SOMETHING by episode end — not just curious, but emotionally invested
      → This emotional moment = the reason they will recommend the show to someone else

      **PILOT REQUIREMENT 5 — SERIES PROMISE:**
      → Pilot TONE = the contract with audience for the whole series
      → If series is dark — pilot must be dark (not safe/gentle to attract viewers then shock them)
      → If series is funny — pilot must deliver laughs, not just setup
      → RULE: Pilot that breaks tone promise in Episode 2 = audience abandonment

      **PILOT STRESS TEST (show to user before writing Episode 1):**
      1. World established without exposition dump? YES/NO
      2. All major characters visible? YES/NO
      3. Season question planted (not answered)? YES/NO
      4. Episode has its own emotional moment? YES/NO
      5. Tone promise consistent with rest of series? YES/NO

      All 5 must pass before Episode 1 screenplay begins.

      ## CLIFFHANGER TYPOLOGY *(assign type to each episode in Episode Map)*

      *Har episode ka cliffhanger alag type ka hona chahiye — warna audience predict karna shuru kar deti hai.*

      **4 CLIFFHANGER TYPES:**

      **TYPE 1 — ACTION CLIFFHANGER:**
      Physical danger / physical threat / chase / confrontation begins but does not resolve
      Best for: Action episodes, penultimate episodes before major arcs
      Audience psychology: "Kya woh bach jayega?" — urgency, fear
      OVERUSE WARNING: More than 2 consecutive action cliffhangers = predictable

      **TYPE 2 — REVELATION CLIFFHANGER:**
      New information revealed that recontextualizes EVERYTHING before it
      Best for: Mid-arc episodes, post-bottle-episode reveals
      Audience psychology: "Yeh toh sab galat tha..." — shock, re-evaluation
      OVERUSE WARNING: Revelations that do not recontextualize are just information — they do not pull

      **TYPE 3 — EMOTIONAL CLIFFHANGER:**
      Relationship rupture / declaration / betrayal — no physical danger, only emotional stakes
      Best for: Character-driven series, relationship arcs
      Audience psychology: "Ab yeh log kaise theek honge?" — concern, investment in people
      OVERUSE WARNING: Requires strong character investment first — works best in middle and late episodes

      **TYPE 4 — QUESTION CLIFFHANGER:**
      An unexplained event / mysterious action / ambiguous ending that raises a question
      Best for: Thriller/mystery series, first episodes of an arc
      Audience psychology: "Yeh kya tha? Yeh kyun hua?" — curiosity, puzzle-solving drive
      OVERUSE WARNING: Questions must be answered within 2-3 episodes — unresolved questions feel like cheating

      **EPISODE MAP CLIFFHANGER ASSIGNMENT:**
      For each episode in the Episode Map, specify:
      Cliffhanger Type: [1-Action / 2-Revelation / 3-Emotional / 4-Question]
      Why this type here: [one sentence rationale]

      **VARIETY RULE:** No two consecutive episodes should use the same cliffhanger type.
      Map your cliffhanger sequence across all episodes and verify variety.

      **CLIFFHANGER SEQUENCE EXAMPLE (8 episodes):**
      EP1: Type 4 (Question) | EP2: Type 1 (Action) | EP3: Type 3 (Emotional) | EP4: Type 2 (Revelation/Midseason) | EP5: Type 4 (Question) | EP6: Type 3 (Emotional) | EP7: Type 1 (Action) | EP8: Resolution (no cliffhanger — season complete)

    agent: "beat-sheet-specialist"
    action: |
      Standard Beat Sheet workflow per episode.
      Read: season-bible.md + character-relations.md + episode synopsis.

      Beat Sheet must reflect:
      - Episode's designated core relationship dynamic
      - Emotional arc (episode start feeling → episode end feeling)
      - Season arc advancement (which beat advances the big story)

    action: |
      Standard Screenplay workflow per episode.

      CRITICAL: Read character-relations.md before writing ANY scene.
      Every scene between two characters = their history + power + unsaid all present.

      Dialogue writer uses "Subtext Web" from character-relations.md to write
      dialogue where what's said ≠ what's meant ≠ what's wanted.

      ## THEME STRESS TEST — SEASON LEVEL *(Run at STEP 12 — Season Consistency Review)*

      *Season ka theme sirf premiere episode mein hona kaafi nahi — finale mein bhi jawab milna chahiye.*

      **SEASON THEME STATEMENT:**
      From Season Bible — "Yeh season kehta hai ki ___________"
      If not clearly stated → extract from Season Question + character arcs + thematic subtext

      **EPISODE-BY-EPISODE THEME AUDIT:**
      For each episode, verify:
      → Does this episode ADVANCE, COMPLICATE, or CHALLENGE the season theme?
      → OR does this episode only serve plot/pacing?

      Episodes that only serve plot but not theme = filler risk = audience disengagement

      **THEME PRESENCE SCORE:**
      - Count episodes actively serving theme: [X] of [total episodes]
      - Target: 80%+ of episodes connect to theme
      - Episodes below threshold: flag for revision in STEP 12

      **FINALE THEME CLOSURE:**
      → Does the finale answer the Season Question in a way that RESOLVES the theme?
      → Not necessarily happy — but thematically COMPLETE
      → Example: Theme = "Trust is earned not assumed" → Finale shows protagonist making a trust decision that IS earned through the whole season journey

      **THEME VIOLATION PATTERNS (flag if found):**
      X Theme stated in dialogue (characters explaining the lesson)
      X Finale contradicts theme (happy ending that undermines the season exploration)
      X Episodes 5-7 completely forget theme (mid-season plot-only zone)
      X Different episodes push contradictory themes (inconsistent philosophical core)

      **PASS CONDITION:** 80%+ episode theme presence + finale closes season question thematically
      **FLAG:** Under 80% → list specific episodes for targeted revision

  - "Character arcs season-bible se kabhi deviate nahi — woh blueprint hai"

philosophy: |
  Web Series ka magic yeh hai ki audience characters ke saath REHTA hai.
  10 ghante. 5 episodes. Ya 13 episodes.

  Is waqt mein character sirf story ka pawn nahi hota — woh aik zinda insaan ban jaata hai
  jisko audience judge karta hai, judge karta hai, phir samajhta hai, phir love karta hai.

  Isliye web series mein relationships slowly, carefully, meaningfully badlani chahiye.
  Ek episode mein koi relationship completely transform nahi hoti —
  woh weeks mein, episodes mein, slowly hoti hai — jaise real life mein.

  Season Bible yeh ensure karta hai ki yeh transformation planned hai,
  intentional hai, aur audience ke liye earned hai.
